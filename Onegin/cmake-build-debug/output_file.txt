A CHRONOLOGY OF ALEXANDER SERGEEVICH PUSHKIN
A London dandy hair all curled
A Moscow winter would be nice
A Muscovite in Harolds cloak
A Quaker Bigotmight one ask
A Russian familys ageold story
A Venus temple graves and greenery
A backwoods genius he commuted
A beauty languid and enchanted
A beetle hummed The peasant choirs
A bit provincial and affected
A blessed and most favoured land
A blessing bountiful and tender
A bloody roastbeefs on the table
A bloody spectre seemed to rise
A bold kibitka skips and burrows
A bold mazurka grips the crowd
A bold reply too blunt a frown
A book of Schillers from the rack
A bottle of some sparkling wine
A brace of pistols and a shot
A brazen chap all starched and proud
A breath of warmth The pipe smoke passes
A broken fence a wicket gate
A broken set but he was thrifty
A butterfly in blooms of May
A call to ring throughout the ages
A captive of his lot and duty
A careless drawl a tiny stutter
A cause for all the monde to tattle
A cause for solemn satisfaction
A charming fool at loves vocation
A charming lad though somewhat wild
A child herself for childrens fun
A clump of snow will fall and glimmer
A coldly jealous selfish brute
A contest for his crown  or thine
A cottage with two rowans yonder
A couch two cupboards and a table
A country house  a windowsill  
A country missinfatuated
A country squire there he stands
A crab upon a spider sat
A craving for a change of air
A cross not many choose to bear
A crowd of slaves on every side
A curious and keen lorgnette
A dactyl from an anapest
A dark and seething torrent races
A deathly pallor merely covered
A dinner fanciful and idle
A disenchanted opera glass
A distance luminous and boundless   
A distant and secluded nook
A drawnout tale of fancies grand
A drink of lingonberry flavour
A due respect for his afflictions
A fair Venetian at my side
A faithful friend a peaceful squire
A family with a single creed
A feast of youthful fancies free
A fervent author used to show
A few words on the Onegin stanza The main body of the novel consists in its final form some stanzas having been discarded by Pushkin for a variety of reasons of some  stanzas of a common design The fourteen lines of this stanzaic form suggest of course the sonnet but the rhyming pattern is unique ababccddeffegg as is the adherence to a fixed sequence of masculine and feminine rhymes that is rhymes in which the stresses fall on the final or the penultimate syllables respectively fmfmffmmfmmfmm The metre iambic tetrameter though it may seem somewhat terse for a long narrative poem in English is hardly in itself alien to our tradition Compositionally the stanzas are organized in a variety of ways as a single unit as octave and sestet or as three quatrains and a couplet The second quatrain may function as two couplets ccdd and the sestet as two linked tercets eff egg The three quatrains it will be noted employ in sequence the three possible patterns for a binary rhyme scheme alternating abab balanced ccdd and enclosed effe Pushkin uses his sonnetparagraph with great virtuosity and flexibility The opening quatrain and the closing couplet are usually the
A final and complete relief
A fleeing hare would cross her way
A fool at eighteen years of age
A freedomloving noble heart
A friend of mine whom you   correctly 
A frosty night the sky resplendent
A funeral verse for his old friend
A gambler and a guards cadet
A garden by the glinting river
A glance in any other book
A gloried name his silenced lyre
A glutton grafter and buffoon
A goateed witch is on a mop
A golden sparkling fine champagne
A greybeard too    with scented hair
A grizzled Kalmuk came to meet them
A happy and immortal breed
A harvest brief each generation
A haughty skeleton sits pouting
A hoary frothing wave that strains
A horde of monsters in a ring
A horse of spirit fit to bridle
A hot pursuit of flaming glances
A housewife now is what I treasure
A huge and matted bear appeared
A hunter hidden in the brush
A is like a mistressfrisky
A jutting branch looms up attacking
A kerchief on her grizzled head
A ladys love I say to you
A laidout corpse was what he found
A lancer has enthralled her deep
A lancer whom she loves with passion
A land by which the mind is fired
A laudable and worthy goal
A learned if pedantic sort
A lexicon of words in vogue   
A liar still Lyubv Petrvna
A line or two of Virgils art
A linen cloth with silken stitch
A little learning means a lot
A little maidens meek affection
A little walk some rest and play
A lively varied atmosphere
A living pictures pallid double
A lonely boat would sail along
A lovers secret assignation   
A magic night the moons embrace   
A maiden somewhat ripe in glow
A maidens foreign words of passion
A maidens lookingglass she keeps
A man whose heart and soul and mind
A manor house and grove below
A mere exchange of looks conveyed
A mere selfportrait in the end
A misty dream of what might be
A moments thought whose trace shall last
A monster of Satanic feature
A most unfortunate condition
A murmur through the ballroom steals   
A nameless rivers placid scene
A new persona has arrived
A noble heart and upright mind
A noisy swarm to meadow bloom
A nook where pensive dryads played
A novel in the older vein
A pack of barking dogs chased round her
A painful joy that lifts her gloom
A partial viewthe poets curse
A patterned vision spread before me
A perfect love of righteous ways
A perilous and shaky bridge
A pistol cocked and lifted high
A pond for ducks to wallow free
A prize to make the French feel proud
A proper challenge or cartel 
A quilted gown and cuckolds horn
A quittent at a modest rate
A rending cry amid the strife
A rogue and gossip night and noon
A roguish rhyme to tease the smitten
A roving pedlar one day brought
A rumbling black abyss did yawn  
A secret wreath that hung there swaying
A serving boy took cream around
A simile in many ways
A simple Russian family throng
A simple and affecting tune
A simple but a nice old lady
A simple stone adjoins the brook
A single feeling in his breast
A slave of God and Brigadier
A spirit strange but full of fire
A stable fence and kitchen shed
A standing deer with horns held low
A stately general at her heels
A story rich in feelings too
A stranger who had wandered in
A stream of elegies then flows
A stream that bubbles foams and hisses
A substitute for joy Id find
A sudden clink of spurs rings loudly
A sudden faintness comes upon her
A swarm of dreams both sad and tender
A swarm of thoughts with every word
A tale of lovers and their lot
A tempting riddle of confusions
A tender dream that she someday
A tender novel with that name
A thousand walks in evenings calm
A throng of nymphs her guardian band
A tiny window glitters brightly
A tombstone tells the passerby
A traveller home from distant faring
A truer love youll never find
A trusting soul in callous fashion
A twinge at least of some bursitis
A valleylily come to flower
A vast neglected garden made
A verse to warn that Tanya tarried
A victim draped in lavish veil   
A voice proclaim Well then hes dead
A waddling redfoot goose now scurries
A warmth in you quite unexpected
A waxing crescent moon on high
A way to calm her troubled mind
A wild creature sad and pensive
A windmill there was squatjig dancing
A word of candid explanation
A word of warning should suffice
A worthy object Never mind
A youthful friend for some infraction
APPENDIX
Abandon Hope Who Enter Here
About her clothes one couldnt fault her
About the olden days    you know
About the stable many cried
About this unknown belle hed found
Above a tambour to enrich
Above his bed and holds him fast
Above my bed a gentle lover
Above our waters iron bridges
Above some letter that shes reading
Above the Nevas placid water
Above the chessboard deep in thought
Above the lonely sea    and then
Above the mist And now the stream
Above their brows the sign of Hades
Absorbed his soul as he was shown
Abused him roundly used the knife
Accept my thanks and admiration
Accepting hostage bonds with rapture
Across from Tanyathere they place them
Across the misted panes a row
Across the river smoky fires
Across these once imperilled passes
Adds colour lightly and with love
Adorned the course of rural leisure
Adrift in idle slothful ways
Afraid the scoundrel might refuse
Agafon by asking the name of the first stranger she encountered a girl hoped to learn the name of her future fianc The name that Tatyana hears Agafon from the Greek Agathon sounds particularly rustic and oldfashioned and therefore comic to a Russian ear
Again and again the work demonstrates that cultural myths are deeply embedded in the modern consciousness that we cannot disentangle ourselves from our words or extricate our selves from our texts None of this happily seems to make human nature in Pushkins eyes any less real or human characters any less responsible for their actions The disguises we wear and the poses we assume or contrastingly the more active and creative roles that we may elect to play in life define us as human beings
Again hed done his moral duty
Against a sky all blue and tender
Against the heavens pallid glow
Against the ramparts granite shelf
Against the ramrods mallets pound
Against the will inside their brains
Ah Moscow How that sound is freighted
Ah blest indeed    although its true
Ah dearest feet where have you vanished
Ah friends I too have been delighted
Ah friends those friends I greatly fear
Ah me these poets    such a hurry
Ah then perhaps the love she bore
Ah whither whither are ye banished
Ah wintertime    The peasant cheerful
Ah yes he loved in such a fashion
Ai I find is much too risky
Alas His fiance has scorned him
Alas Tatyanas fading quickly
Alas Upon lifes furrowed plain
Alas We humans all ignore
Alas it isnt hard to guess
Alas its true Eugenes demented
Alas too salty now theyre bringing
Alas with welldeserved derision
Albions great and haughty lyre the reference is to Byrons poetry
Alexander Pushkin  is the poet and writer whom Russians regard as both the source and the summit of their literature Not only is he revered like Shakespeare in the English tradition or Goethe in the German as the supreme national poet but he has become a kind of cultural myth an iconic figure around whom a veritable cult of idolatry has been fashioned This exalted status that Pushkin has been accorded in his own land has been something of a disservice to the living reality of his works and it contrasts oddly with the more modest reputation that Pushkin has secured abroad To many nonnative readers of Russian literature the panegyrics of his compatriots seem excessive and indeed in their eyes Pushkin has been somewhat overshadowed by the great Russian writers who came after him They do not comprehend why these writers themselves generally grant him the first and highest place in their pantheon of artistic geniuses For those who do not read Pushkin in his own language the situation remains perplexing and the questions persist just who is he and why almost without exception do the most perceptive of his compatriots regard him as one of the worlds greatest artists

All his creative life Pushkin suffered from the indignities and impositions of an autocratic state exile in his youth the frustrations of police surveillance and a grossly interfering censorship in his later years the constant and onerous obligations of government service and the continuing humiliation of having to rely on imperial favour In an effort to secure his independence from such state control over his affairs he gave his political allegiance to a kind of aristocratic party seeing in the old Russian landed gentry the class to which he himself was born the only viable check on the arbitrary power of the autocracy This aligned him as well in a literary sense with the notion prevalent among the educated members of lite society that the writers appropriate role was that of the gentleman littrateur a view of the artist that probably hindered Pushkin in his effort during the last decade of his life to transform himself into a truly free and independent professional writer He never succeeded finally in escaping from either the constraints of court pressure or his own persistent allegiance to a fading aristocratic culture His further development as an artist was abruptly terminated by his death in a duel at the age of

All this today seems antiquated
All thoughts of time returninggroundless
All tragicohysteric moaning
All vain and languorous with pride
All victims someof wars distress
All weeds No wreath is on the bough
All wet comes off in crumbly snow
Alls quiet now Inside the parlour
Alone amid his new possessions
Alone and sunk in calculation
Alone beside the windowcase
Alone both day and night through life
Alone the shepherd grey and weary
Alone upon his way he goes
Along a forest road he surges
Along a street that gently drowses
Along the Nevas bank by sleigh
Along the Petersburg chausse
Along the merry streets youll hear
Along with fashions long since dead
Already bored to uncles bed
Already cross and irritated
Already has she mastered guile
Already learned to cheat and smile
Alright Ill go Well done first class
Although Eugene with care inspected
Although Onegins inclination
Although he seldom saw their sense
Although he thought him lacking heart
Although her tears were all too brief
Although the book she read presented
Although to us theyre hardly new
Am quite as glad to write as you
Am quite content to read for hours
Amid his conquests of the hour
Amid his feasts to no avail
Amid his pleasures and their blaze
Amid its magic brooks and quarters
Amid its park In sombre dress
Amid our forbears vaunted day
Amid the drifting snowbound spaces
Amid the stillness of the night
Amid the tumult and the still
Amid this peaceful life they cherished
Amid this worlds deceptive glitter
Amid those mournful crags on high
Among the pines would gently turn
Among themselves they put her down
Amusements yield the careless fruit
An aged unclesin my book
An always bold impassioned speech
An edict that was meant you see
An elegy to show he cared
An empty phantom or a joke
An endless bottle of champagne
An epigram of cunning spite
An episode too slight to mention
An honest man whod served sincerely
An idle stillness rules the sky
An inn at every stage en route
And Anna Pvlovna as ever
And Benedetto hed intone
And Christendom will institute
And Egypts son as well youll see
And Floras cheek I quite agree
And Flynov whod been reeling badly
And Gallicisms in a sentence
And Good and Evil Life and Fate
And Grandison the noble lord
And I as yet could not uncover
And I can hear your stern reply
And I confess from them I fled
And I confess in public sorrow
And I lament old sorrows yet
And I must die without a moan 
And I recalling poor Svetlana
And I so meekly heard you preach
And I surrender to my fate
And I was just thirteen that year
And I who saw my single duty
And Ialas I must confess
And Ill be faithful all my life
And Im deprived of this for you 
And Im not loathe to let it go
And Lensky falls the shadows thicken
And Lensky formed a low opinion
And Lensky too a light shines out
And Moscow countless beauties too
And Olga too Eugene alertly
And Olga too an invitation
And Petushkv as well went under
And Strasbourg pie that deathless fable
And Tanya now no longer quaking
And Tanya sees with trepidation
And Tanyas youth now glimmers darkly
And Werther that rebellious martyr
And all around her dully gleaming
And all its solid form reflected
And all that crowd of local rabble
And all that final summer season
And all that quickens and excites
And all the ditches that abound
And all the hilltops soft and glowing
And all the monsters fled the room
And all the social rabble snatches
And all the while her soul was aching
And all the while she guards her heart
And all the while the moon was shining
And all the world in silence lay
And all the yearnings in our breast
And all those beauties once appealing
And all weve learned from its great store
And all worn out she wept a bit
And almost even left her spouse
And almost fall the poor things ready
And analyst of dreams unclear
And antiquated turns of phrase
And apropos I might make mention
And are your kinfolk well today
And arguments and happy times
And arm in arm they seek their chairs
And armed with your good staff 
And artifice that ladies share
And as I watch them disappearing
And as he bid the girl goodnight
And as his years of youth abated
And as she gazed upon that place
And as she reads a tear will rise
And asks the stranger passing by
And at a walk shell ride dejected
And at her frightened cry a troop
And at the altar by his side
And at their table guests were served
And ate and drank in just his robe
And back at home shes overdue
And bade the envoy if he cared
And barely stir all weighted down
And barred from being loved  or fooled
And barren age has shown its face
And be avenged that very day
And beats an iridescent wing
And beckon to each passing sail
And been a faithful wife and mother
And been as happy  as I could
And beg you for your kind protection 
And bending whispers her gallantly
And bid us thuswise to renew
And bids us cast away the crown
And bind him tighter with our rope
And blest the dark that comes to stay
And blest who ripened in his prime
And blest with all its cares the day
And blind as ever still believing
And boldly put for belle Nina
And bows hed mastered absolutely
And breathes upon the chilly glass
And brilliant day begin to bloom
And brings in merry mood before her
And brought along Monsieur Triquet
And by the Heavens was endowed
And by the country tavern door
And by the matchwoods crackling light
And by the moonlit grave they kept
And by the window read it through
And by these coastal cliffs enthralled
And cannot ever read my fill
And caped in storms shall I go questing
And captures worldly fame to boot
And cattle wandring oer the lea
And chase from nearby hills the snow
And cheek in hand as down she peers
And claps salute him Tanya feels
And cleanse this Chapter Five at last
And cleared the darkened mind she found
And climbed a gentle hill by night
And coachmen by the fires glow
And cold himself gave warmth its due
And come to know a new regret
And commerce reigns in all the streets
And could she now have been so bold
And countless tearsthe gentle balm
And country dress would find no mercy
And cracked and waved its sails while prancing
And crosses dense with flocks of daws
And cursing womans crooked course
And cuts the ice with ringing skates
And cutting off Eugenes reply
And damns his folly in these matters
And damns their idle ways and patter
And deep within her rustic bower
And distant lands where once hed shed
And does not heed my present woes
And does so still have no illusion
And down he goes The first snow flurries
And drink the draught of loves temptations
And driven home alone to bed
And driven home to change and preen
And drops of tears    while on a hassock
And drove back home immersed in thought
And drowsy nature smiling lightly
And each takes pistol into hand
And early church bellswhen they chime
And earn me tribute paid to fame
And economics he knew well
And ended up the dunce instead
And enigmatic Sbogar too
And enmity with harsh contempt
And entertain the nearly dead
And even in their slander dreary
And even now my dearest vision
And even part whole mountain ridges
And even simpleminded fun
And even there it seems to win
And ever brighter brighter grow
And ever faster on she reels
And everyone who chose to speak
And face to face with his own soul
And fames delicious agitation
And famous But the plaintive measure
And far aheadCaucasian masses
And far from town now set your course
And far niente rules my leisures
And fear assails her in a panic
And feel a deep commiseration
And feverish with lyric vision
And fill the page that follows mine
And filled my soul with dreams content
And filled with truths own vivid glows
And filling all his meditations
And finally left it when they bought
And find the country unappealing 
And fled afar    and she as well
And fled the woods and fields seclusion
And flies uphill with all his speed
And flock to tranquil wisdoms crest
And following the old tradition
And fondly watched her girlhood games
And for us both ahead there waited
And for which song he paid at last
And former counslor old man Flynov
And found in one a list of wages
And found the source of lyric fire
And found their solemn conversations
And fresh new linen from the bin
And friendly husbands hard to bear
And friends and friendship less intriguing
And from one charming foot her slipper
And from the hut come cries and din
And full of doubt her spirits sinking
And fumed in sullen indignation
And gallops off Now nothing mattered
And gave the neighbours equal reason
And gave the neighbours quite a treat
And gazing at the moon shed nourished
And gazing softly she embraces
And girls prefer The Kittys Song
And glances slyly through the door
And glidesso peaceful and transcendent   
And good and bad all intertwine
And grandly youll see winter through
And grant the world redeeming grace
And grim repentance gnaws his heart
And gusting snowflakes flash and spin
And had its true no inclination
And halt the constant surge of blushes
And happiness was ours  so nearly
And happy hed have learned life truly
And hasnt stirred still slumber hovers
And hasten rather to forestall
And haughty dames    then calmly stops
And haunt their dreams They worship now
And have they not the charming fools
And he alas by friend lies killed
And he believed that men would tender
And he recalled Tatyanas pallor
And he recalled at least in part
And he recalled with grim emotion
And hearing my sweet stanzas soar
And held my flaming bosom fast
And here  at this unhappy turn
And here Mickiwicz sang inspired
And here great Mithridates died
And heres Oneginliberated
And heres Oneginlord and master
And heres Petrvsky Castle hoary
And heres Prolzov celebrated
And heres a chap whose words are biting
And heres a household boy gone sleighing
And heres an envoy speaking slyly
And heres my Tanya Lord its ages
And heres the hearth spoke up the crone
And heres the masters study dear
And him for whom by fates command
And his sad fate drew us apart 
And his sly odist in The Other 
And hold a placid conversation  
And hold the lucky stirrup steady
And honest virtue won the day
And honoured patron of the barre
And how are our dear neighbours faring
And how hed seize a moments weakness
And how his wicked tongue would gore him
And how the ladies eyes he lit
And hows the plague What conflagrations
And human speech and hoofbeat taps
And humble lot hed once rejected   
And hung the limbs of oaks with white
And if it is who wants to know
And ill at ease he scarcely tries
And in a letter rash and green
And in a trice they seat the pair
And in deceit will take no part
And in exchange he also took
And in her gaudy mantle rages
And in her hands a French romance
And in her heart the thought was planted   
And in her native tongue I fear
And in my garden she appeared
And in my heart I cried Its he
And in the country hed have worn
And in the end were close as brothers
And in the margins she inspected
And in the morning he wont know
And in the next an almanac
And in the novels final pages
And in the princess then who wouldnt
And in the solitude her passion
And in the tomb his shade shall never
And in the wings    the assignations
And in their dens bewailed as one
And in their singsong tones impart
And in this poets cup of mine
And in those days when I was blest
And in your coming God has spoken 
And innocence can lead to woe
And introduced a new regime
And irked by fleet success soon after
And is there no return of youth
And it may touch some heart with fire
And jealous anguish pierced her breast
And judge her harshly from the start
And judge me both by word and deed
And keep to silent meditation
And land of harsh forbidding places
And late the lazy East still slumbers
And later secretly demean them
And laughs out loud between his howls
And lays her down upon the floor
And lays her on a makeshift bed
And leave him reader at his station  
And leave no trace however slender
And leaves her languid soul ignited
And left Eugene in mute dismay
And left her husband at a loss
And left them too without vexation
And let the conversation die
And letters in a maidens hand
And life went smoothly after that
And lifting up her veil shell read
And lighter than a swallow saying
And lightly clad would take a stroll
And like the family circles charm
And liked his common sense in part
And listen for the hearts first beat
And lo my beauty calmly passes
And loathes the awful thing hes done
And loathes this world with all her being
And locked him in a darkened den
And long he stood in sorrow aching
And long she stood bewitched and glowing
And long she watched the road theyd taken
And long since time Im sure youd say
And looked about perplexed and chastened
And lost lifes very bloom in truth
And loved you with a girlish hunger
And loves sweet crown of jubilations
And lures us to the tree of mystery
And maddened pangs of loves refrain
And made me thine for evermore 
And make them magic songs anew
And makes no effort to astound
And malice rules a petty mind
And man of honour nothing less
And managed somehow to remain
And managed to dispel her trance
And many more But her confusion
And may his dear old bones be blest
And maybe secret apprehension
And meantime Ive just now completed
And meantime feigning resignation
And mediocrity alone
And merely as an idle scheme
And mid the hum and hush of life
And mileposts soothe the idle eye
And millions of our fellow creatures
And mind the beauty of his nails
And missed the room shed always had
And modern man himself portrayed
And more than once in cotton cap
And mornings read some book right through   
And mortgaged all the land he could
And mourn him yet    But wherefore mourn
And mourned his ashes with a sigh
And my Zaretsky as Ive said
And my first cousin good Buynov
And nameless pangs and sweet perdition   
And nature seemed to wait and wait
And natures made of wayward stuff
And neath it toute vous Annette 
And neath the misty moon on high
And neath the spreading willow tree
And neither distance nor the chain
And never asked if she agreed
And no ones ears were shocked a bit
And nothing grand or more refined
And nothing issued from his quill
And noting how poor Tanya shook
And novels set her heart aglow
And now I seize the first occasion
And now alas    she lives attended
And now along Tverskya Street
And now another tries to trip her
And now at last the wait has ended
And now from nearby quarters brothers
And now hes at the porch at last
And now his gazing eye discovers
And now its time indeed long past
And now malignant in intention
And now my friends I hear once more
And now she feels her kerchief go
And now she leaps And now she whirls
And now they trundle Tanya daily
And now with solemn mien and dying
And now with what great concentration
And nursing noble passions rages
And oer the lacquered boards we glide
And of a friendly glass or two
And off runs glutton youth to capture
And off the guests would drive well fed
And oftentimes shed sit all day
And oh how base to pamper grossly
And oh how many jests and rhymes
And on a rumpled sofa lay
And on arrival duly meet
And on her covered table serves
And on her lips a slender smile
And on her shoulder rests his head   
And on my heart retain their hold
And on the leaves of recollection
And on the road    grown lean and fearless
And on the snow make rainbows glitter
And on the spice of malice thriving
And on the whole despised mankind
And on those pages everywhere
And once inside that silent study
And once when riding battle station
And only nanny might have guessed
And our Katnin gave us there
And over all that dusty crowd
And over wine she sang for guests
And pain has made us humble men
And paler than the moon at dawn
And pass him medicines morosely
And picture truly with my pen
And play but chords or turning gently
And playfully astound the young
And pledge of life beyond this earth
And ploughs a trail of fluffy furrows
And plunging into deep despond
And poet filled with Kantian truth
And pondered my Zarmas fate   
And presently induced a snore
And propped upon an elbow writing
And proved unfaithful to her grief
And purely to delight and pamper
And pushes slightly on the door   
And quickly blamed him heaven knows
And quite contented with his fate
And quite devoid of affectations
And quite forgot Its pathway now
And racks where modish rhymesters wilt
And rather glad he was its true
And raven locks of shoulder reach
And read my Apuleius keenly
And read the books hed called his own
And read the future by the moon
And really you prefer the other
And recollect a time thats gone
And reverently I guard it still
And rightly so in inquisition
And round Eugene there soon collected
And rushed to greet her rhyming love
And said a prayer to soothe my plight
And sang of childhood effervescent
And sang the Salghir captives praises
And scarce alive cried out goodbye
And scorning then Apollos ire
And sealed the solemn compact fast
And seen in all   Onegins face
And sees the grave before it yawn
And sees the truth she loves him yet 
And send these fruits of inspiration
And set beside the poets glass
And sets its sails for far and near
And settled down and grew contented
And several maidens far from gay
And shall I then in silence yawn
And she as if by fire seared
And she from whom I drew impassioned
And she my willing lips will teach
And she was not the sort who glories
And she whose beauty I admire
And ships to us by Baltic seas
And show you how he spent each day
And showed poor Tanya when he freed her
And sighed recalling their interment
And sighing started home for bed
And silently he hung his head
And silently his pistol drops
And since I dried your baby tears
And since I pulled you by the ears
And since each rule permits exceptions
And since my gingerbread surprised you
And sings of Volga fishers plaiting
And sit for hours seeing naught
And sleeps beside her through the night
And slowly day begins its flight
And slurp from salty shells those bites
And smothered yawns with brittle laughter
And snorts in fear the traveller shivers
And so Eugene learned all about
And so I lived in old Odessa   
And so I offer worthy spouses
And so Inebriated lover
And so by countryside tradition
And so dear reader grant me pause
And so decayed until he duly
And so estranged these former friends
And so far off in thought she wandered
And so for all his fiery mettle
And so for once Eugene elected
And so he killed eight years of youth
And so in secret she requested
And so in slow but growing fashion
And so lets hasten to the walk
And so lets part farewell   adieu
And so lifes afternoon has started
And so our maiden fully tasted
And so scarce breathing down she hastened
And so she turned for loves discussion
And so the friends departed
And so the prince led up to greet her
And so they metlike wave with mountain
And so they took me off to strangers 
And so was not in any measure
And so your mistress faithful minion
And so youre off   forgive me then
And soft seductive nights as well
And softly dim her gentle eyes
And some few novels done with power
And some of Venus some of Piles
And some old manwhen he espied her
And sometimes he himself got bled
And sometimes in the evening hours
And somewhat pale too thin and small
And soon a great discovery brought her
And soon quite soon the tempests core
And soon the fragrant tea was flowing
And soon the general verdict ran
And soon the open doorway beckoned
And soon the square grows gay and vital
And soon with ringing slabs of slate
And sought in vain to catch her eye
And sparkles dance before her eyes
And sparkling Southern sun dispenses
And sparkling in the sunlights shimmer
And spleen he saw would dog his life
And starts to sing offkey Loud cheering
And steer for now a new direction
And steps inside The crush increases
And sterner cares now seek admission
And still consumes enough for two
And stirs in me I wont conceal
And stoves of tile in many shades
And straightway too to all her kin
And strength of mind were working still
And strikes his chair against the floor
And strip the forest bare all round
And stuff him with the play I wrote
And summon forth a sombre bliss
And sure enough a note came flying
And talk all day once they begin
And tears asunder winters chains
And tears her golden earrings out
And tell him that hes not to mention
And thanks the Lord for ruts and mire
And the majestic antlered cuckold
And their dull means to festive ends
And then Eugene approached and spoke
And then Ill write this world a song
And then Monsieur took on the child
And then a sudden thought came gleaming
And then at home all day he stays
And then at thirty married well
And then await sweet recompense
And then by post Eugene was speeding
And then good God she starts to bawl
And then he saw that country byways
And then he soared his soul alight
And then hed dress   
And then her warm imagination
And then in private hed prepare
And then in silence meditated
And then maintain the shameless fiction
And then mid trees a hut emerges
And then postponed till they could get
And then the benthead oxen pant
And then the dream came true for me
And then the guest would be invited
And then the other slowly twirls
And then their waltzing is repeated
And then theres Southern sun and ocean   
And then they ask in compensation
And then upon the end of play
And then waxed voluble once more
And then with doubt in fullest measure
And then with verse of quickened sadness
And there   ethereal  resplendent
And there my glowing pipe ignited
And there the Muse spread out for me
And there the caustic Shakhovsky
And there the crush the glare the heat
And there the nightingale springs lover
And there the ploughman rests at will
And there where Tartar tongues are spoke
And there where now his ashes lie
And there where southern waves break high
And theres Mashk all greenencased
And these suggest a spa or two
And they prevailed Her lips more steady
And think at my untimely grave
And though I grieve I weep no more
And though immune to readings charm
And though thank God he never acted
And though the language of my friend
And though were loath to cast aspersions
And thought What foolishness to wreck
And thus more surely we undo her
And thus preserved by fates decree
And thus they aged as do all mortals
And time would pass till Olgad brew
And to each mad and fevered rout
And to her doll without demur
And to our rhyming guild calls down
And to the opera we must get
And to their passions ever cold
And took at last to coming down
And trail the seemly crowds procession
And treads on toes to reach his seat
And trembles like a hunted fawn
And tried to write But arts exaction
And truffles youths delight so keen
And turned coquette A fickle toddler
And uncurbed passions ruled the day
And under heels parquet would crack
And use a furtive ear to spy
And used to say Oh grant me life
And verses will be common duties
And vibrant life in taking root
And visited the humble tents
And waits impatient in her clearing
And waits impatiently to hear
And wakes her nurse to share her plight
And wakes to find her room alight
And walked the boy in Letny Park
And wallow friends both you and I
And wanders through those woods all day
And was it not in past enjoyment
And was it you I heard replying
And watched a different world unfold
And we as well shall face that hour
And we now press our wilful claim
And wears that same tulle bonnet yet
And weeping they undid my plait
And were deceived by it in turn
And wet the metal bit with foam
And what a soul    Come visit do
And what an awesome dream shes dreaming
And what does Fate prepare for me
And what ensued from that event
And what of keen lorgnettes I say  
And what of other fascinations
And what we called a fop no less
And what would be your own reaction
And when Eugene drew my attention
And when across this world I pass
And when he found it necessary
And when he tried to speak at last
And when he wished hed make appear
And when we wish it always ready
And where are stormy loves desires
And where are you poetic fires
And where has youth glib rhyme been banished
And where my buried heart is kept
And where that gloomy strange betrayer
And where the tearstains    Not a trace
And wheres her sister now poor lass
And whether pierced
And while the honest chap conferred
And while the horses bored at tether
And while the lamps both in and out
And while the people still are tapping
And while the weary band of servants
And whiskers tusks and tufted tails
And whisper to each other closely
And whist which reigns supreme today
And whistling fires with a rush
And who emerged when it was lifted
And wholl be kind enough to measure
And why  Lordhave I not felt
And why for gold it need not strive
And why not let the poet rage
And wind the mornings herald rushes
And winters joys in every shade
And with a heart thats warm and tender
And with a smile the world caressed us
And with a spirit never still
And with a wistful sigh he muses
And with a yawn took up his pen
And with an elbow each one prodded
And with good cause he found it better
And with her wrinkled hand the nurse
And with its murky light defining
And with my wilful Muse lets hustle
And with one voice the grannies cry
And with the moons celestial light
And with their usual sort of bluster
And with these words he drained his glass
And women reapers come to fill
And wont then be evaluated
And woods where once I used to roam
And worked her way across the torrent
And yet I think Id wish to claim
And yet Ill say on his behalf
And yet a trip in winter season
And yet her husband loved her dearly
And yet hes stubborn    still resistant
And yet the regal moon shines brighter
And yetalthough his eyes were reading
And yield my rights to loves translation   
And you good reader with your hunches
And you my sentimental pretties
And you my true ideal my own
And you my youthful inspiration
And you small book my constant labour
And youthful hopes on youthful wings
Anisya came in just a second
Announcing dawn and working time
Annoyed with leisure and inaction
Another No In all creation 
Another ballroom king on station
Another bard in exaltation
Another captured her affection
Another fruitless day went by
Another memory finds me ready
Another round would hardly hurt them
Another squire chose this season
Another with his loves perfection
Anothers joy anothers pain
Answers the drumbeats duty call
Apostate from the storms of passion
Appear so proud or so forbearing
Appears absurd or overbearing

Approach at will Advancing coldly
Approaches Olga    idly jests
Archival dandies in a cluster
Are Tassos octaves soaring flights
Are always met with warm embraces
Are babbled out and soon revealed
Are empty  Id as soon be trading
Are entered by each wouldbe friend
Are ever thus with brow perplexed
Are filled with girls in sleeps embrace
Are nothing more to us than tools    Since feelings are for freaks and fools
Are out of fashion nowadays
Are quite as faithless as their feet
Are you my angel of salvation
Arises ripens and must fall
Armenian Spaniard Frenchman sleek
Arose    and instantly withdrew
Around each painted belle and dame
Aroused in you some hint of kindness
Arriving home together thus
As Boston ombre old mens play
As Gods my witness dear I promise
As I approached the farm    Enough
As I from my Onegin do
As I in jest so oft pretended
As I must now admit I see
As Olga poured it dark and glowing
As Sadi long before us said
As Tanyas husband enters proudly
As all applaud Onegin enters
As artless as the one you tendered
As at a vexing separation
As bitter losses we recall
As clear as maiden thoughts as candid
As cold and chaste as winter snow
As comrades now Whatever end
As dark forebodings filled her mind
As did derivative Knyazhnin
As did the skeptical old fool
As does a drunk in sleeps embraces
As down the shortest road they fly
As far as Lenskys wedding stood
As fencelike they go flashing by
As first I saw you rise before us
As from the meadow your light trace
As gay as mornings rosy dress
As he descended to the grave
As heavens galaxy shines down
As heeding passions siren song
As if a chilling hand had pressed
As if encased in armoured plate
As if in terror I had read
As if it were some funeral feast
As if they all thought her to blame
As if today through some restriction
As in a dreadful senseless dream
As in a misty dream at night
As in some dull Van Dyck madonna
As infant slumber as the moon
As loves high art   and was applauded
As men today no longer do
As mouths start chewing
As n in French   and through the nose
As once some poet drew himselP
As one whom love had left forsaken
As only poets mad with passion
As others tell of passions swelling
As people say without translation
As phantom daydreams haunt your mind
As sentiments to be derided
As she embraced her younger daughter
As storms refresh the fields of spring
As sweet and trusting children do
As sweet as loves own soft caress
As tears well up to dim her eyes
As through a mist of stifled tears   
As through the dust by post he flew
As vulgar I wont even try
As was the casefor nothing passes
As were the arts of social dealing
As with old friends she keeps returning
As yet unmarked by disillusion
As yet unseen and yet so dear
As you SaintPriest have demonstrated
As you great Homer you whose song
As you of course well know the chap
As your dear waist my sweet Zizi
Aseethe with plentys wares and cries
Ashamed to see himself the clearer
Asked Tanya   and the children leapt
Asked Tanyas mother full of cheer
Asleep till morn beneath her pillow
Assailed by doubts she grew dejected
Assails her heart he brings her light
Assault the senses all at once
Assigned their roomsfrom entrance hall
At Madame Larins country seat
At Shrovetide feasts their table flourished
At Trinity when service brings
At dusk or entre chien et loup
At every turn he seems to find her
At everything around the room
At fifty shed all obligation
At first Madame was in attendance
At first disturbed me in the end
At first hed beg a declaration
At first she didnt wish to read
At first the neighbours calls were steady
At first their differences of heart
At forty hed have had the gout
At greenbaize tables players settle
At home receives him without tension
At home the poet seething paces
At last hes ready for the world
At least one note to linger long
At least three hours he peruses
At masquerade or midnight ball
At my insistence Behind the mill without a word
At such an age in such a year
At talk were even less profound
At tender loves still timid passion
At the beginning of my story
At thirty steps with fine precision
At this unwanted revelation
At times attentive then uncaring
At times he reads her works of fiction
At times the fresh and youthful kisses
Atop a lean and shaggy trotter
Atop the stove to wash and purr
Attempt to ford the muddy street
Attends their giddy conversation
Aurora Leads forth from morning dales the sun
Ausonias  happy sons are humming
Avoiding further explanation
Awaited here in vain surrender
Awakened early none the less
Aware of snow his nag is fearful
A
Bacchantelike at all our revels
Back then it seemed that I required
Back thenfar off from vain commotion
Back to our springtimes golden morn

Base cowards slanderers fullblown
Bassoon and flute announce the band
Be kind and send my doubts away
Be thinking of or merely feeling
Became in time our young mans fate
Because an ardent spirits daring
Because in tripe the solemn find
Because she heeds the call of passion
Because shes trusting more than proud
Because the dull are cramped by wit
Because we take mere talk for action
Become good friends from sheer ennui
Bedbugs and fleas at every station
Bedecked in broadbrimmed Bolivar 
Bedraped in dresses long outmoded
Been foolish when I failed to wait
Been weak at Russian conversation
Before a mansions double gate
Before him faces come and go
Before his darling Olgas face
Before his gaze And these alone
Before no critic will he grovel
Before that gaze so openhearted
Before that soft and simple trust
Before that soul so bright and just
Before the dull and frigid crowd
Before the fronts of darkened houses
Before the hearth the tables laid
Before the hostess in succession
Before the raging gulf ahead
Before the stars disintegration
Before the window on the bed
Before their hands are stained with crime
Before their loyal subjects gaze
Before them now a forest slumbers
Begins to fade The vale emerges
Begins to trace with lovely fingers
Beheld outdoors a wondrous sight
Behind a nearby stump Guillot
Behind her back she hears the bear
Behind his silent study door
Behind the hill the moons a sliver
Behold you at our country place 
Believe me conscience be your token
Believe me you d have never learned 
Believed in dreams and card prediction
Believes the chosen dream shes painted
Beloved friend sweet friend I wait
Bemoans her worthless mate deserted
Bemused and muddled his own rook
Beneath a shady parks protection
Beneath a verse left incomplete
Beneath her parents loving gaze
Beneath it sings as in the past
Beneath my Africas warm sky
Beneath the gleam of lamps and stars
Beneath the lines from other hands
Beneath the moonbeams silver light
Beneath the moons seductive ray
Beneath the skies of distant lands
Beneath the table barely seen
Beneath the waves while older men
Beneath them quiet streamlets wind
Beneath this stone now resteth here
Beneath two pine trees old for ages
Beset with yearning and with rhyme
Beshtu or Besh Tau a fivepeaked mountain eminence in the northern Caucasus
Beshtu the watchman of the waste
Beside a limpid flowing brook
Beside a shorttailed dwarf   and that
Beside a spot where lindens grow
Beside the Spanish envoy pray  
Beside the couples coach below
Beside the door stood tightly laced
Beside the road the sunlight glinted
Beside the tender maidens bed
Betrayals gossip rings and tears
Betrayed was always glad to rest
Between the meat and blancmanger
Between the printed lines lay hidden
Between two aunts beside a column
Betwixt her chores and idle hours
Bewitched by moonlights magic curse  
Beyond this great divide at last
Blending the plain and idealistic
Blind fortunes malice and mens scorn

But give me first a pen and paper
But hardly had she turned and taken
But having read Tatyanas letter
But he departs his hopes in tatters
But he refused to go Hes ready
But he was wrong that idle sinner
But her old wits were slow at best
But here lets honour with affection
But here your trip has left you haggard
But how is one in this dull season
But hush A strident critic rises
But if indeed I overborrow
But if my hapless situation 
But if you knew the anguish in it
But in small town and countryside
But journeys too like all the rest
But just for show as if to spite
But knew by heart a fine collection
But lead them to the altar then
But lest too soon I join the dead 
But let it be Take this collection
But let it be its now too late 
But let us then as friends be parted
But lets abandon idle chatter
But listen as our friends speak low
But lit instead a conflagration
But lo    with crimson hand
But look Onegins at the gateway
But look the crowds astir and humming
But madrigals theyll have you write
But man of honour and of sense
But meanwhile dressed for morning pleasure
But mine must be a brothers role
But moist Odessa all too sadly
But mother with her lamentation
But my Eugene all evening heeded
But my poor Lensky deep at heart
But neither did her form contain
But neither whist nor gossip there
But never would he lead astray
But no Each moment of my days
But no one hears his neighbour out
But no one knew her inclination
But no she cant What explanation   
But no the deal fell through again
But not a trite or vulgar word
But not at all as blithe as ever
But not the timid maid whod pleaded
But not today Although I cherish
But now    What unbecoming schemes
But now  Muse forget the past
But now Didelot is boring stuff
But now a kind and simple soul
But now as in a house deserted
But now at last his doubts were gone
But now blue evening starts to darken
But now he slowly wakes at last
But now her door is softly swinging
But now its changed were all like ladies
But now its late Odessas dreaming
But now its late The winds are blowing
But now its late and time for leaving
But now its over Suppers heeded
But now our minds have grown inactive
But now the chime and watch alert them
But now the hammers smashing boulders
But now the monument stands dreary
But now the moonbeams glowing light
But now the shades of night grow thinner
But now the sun climbs heaven steeply
But now theyre near Before them gleaming
But nowadays Im not so canny
But on the whole not bad at all
But once a weekId see your face 
But once youve had your fatal fun
But one glance back Farewell you bowers
But one long string of dreary scenes
But one persistent thought the while
But only one bright image holds him
But other days bring other dreams
But pantaloons gilet and frock
But pensiveness her friend and treasure
But pleased to have their duty done
But quickly summer seems to fly
But read no Cicero at all
But reading Adam Smith restored him
But recently this winter stayed
But roads are bad now in our nation
But round it boredom seems to hover
But see    Oh nanny dont refuse
But shambles somehow down the way
But she ignores her sisters pleading
But shows a simple quiet air
But shy and frightened does not dare
But simply tell as best I may
But sleep had hardly come to take him
But somehow just the look he gave
But sometimes there are certain pages
But soon her thirsting spirit savoured
But soon she dropped her city pose
But soon the guests are somewhat sated
But speaks of him She cannot bear
But spiteful people saw no beauty
But still Onegin lies within
But still her heart in panic rushes
But still in books he saw no harm
But still we welcome you with feeling
But stop   Enough My babbling lyre
But suddenly a snowbank shifted
But surely Your honours all the pledge 
But sweeter still amid such nights
But sweetheart Ive grown old  I mean   
But taking leave requests permission
But tea is brought the girls demurely
But tell me Lensky how and when
But tell me Prince you wouldnt know
But tell me whats your friend been doing
But tell me which one was Tatyana
But thank the Lord you seem more steady
But that pretentious game is dated
But that will do My beautys letter
But thats enough I must make haste
But then as torpor dulled sensation
But then at last as it was dawning
But then by empty dreams deflected
But then her course abruptly veered
But then she took to keeping house
But then sheer terror seized Tatyana 
But then their charming wives he found
But then their friendship grew and soon
But then they led her to the altar
But there beneath the Finnish sky
But there enough have done at last
But this cool princess so resplendent
But those on whom the Muse has acted
But those to whom as friends and brothers
But thou fair maiden wilt thou come
But though its won no favour yet 
But thrifty neighbours waxed indignant
But to the young its raptures bring
But was he happy in the flower
But we have lots of neighbours call
But we must grant though it offend us
But we must say that he was granted
But we we band of callow joysters
But wearied by the ballrooms clamour
But what care I for all they do
But what did I amazed discover
But what did I then find in you
But what ensued from Tanyas meeting
But what of my Eugene
But what of our Eugene this while
But what was Tanyas stunned reaction
But whats the point Id like to know it
But when Eugenes felicitations
But when did fate cast him our way
But when he reached his uncles haven
But when the age of restless turnings
But when the years have made us older
But when they learned that in the rear
But where God knows All trace is dead
But where Melpomene still stages
But where are all your evenings spent
But where he now no longer reigns   
But where his genius proved unfailing
But where in such a headlong rush
But where such madrigals and roses
But wheres distress Commiseration
But wheres my rambling story rushing
But which today I use no more
But who is that among the chosen
But whom to love To trust and treasure
But why on earth does he inspire
But why succumb to grim emotion
But will he come   She doesnt hear him
But wretched he whos too farsighted
But you Bordeaux I find just right
But you odd tomes of haughty ladies
But you perhaps are not attracted
But you you men in wedded bliss
But youre not even listening pet
But youve gone pale again my child

By Baratynskys penI vow
By Lenskys brief illfated days
By Olgas winning youthful charms
By Tolstoys magic brush and scented
By afternoon hell finally waken
By all the flow of lively wit
By ancient lindens near the brook
By being at this feast he hated
By bringing dreams before her gaze
By briny waves refreshed and righted
By candlelight shed rise and dress
By chance those verses havent vanished
By children and by faithful wife
By clumps of snow and through the summits
By dreams of him each passing hour
By ending his proud days a martyr
By everyone Eugene has fled
By falling gravely ill hes won
By fates mysterious dispensation
By feelings and perturbed no more
By filling them with song instead
By fingers that are learning still
By gardens mansions fashion shops
By his pretentious studied bearing
By joining him at least in grieving
By lonely fields and burbling brook
By making his the thoughts of others
By mighty Zeuss will elected
By pictures of this simple kind
By rank in turn as each deserved
By scientific computation
By seeming in their words at least
By sentry booths and peasant lasses
By shaded cliff a camel lying
By shooting at his pallid face
By snowy blizzards buried deep
By suppers call We country sinners
By sylvan shade that lay implanted
By thoughts of fame and freedom smitten
By thoughts of love by dreams of joy
By turns Tatyana groans and sighs
By tyrantfashions high decrees
Byron
Call out for men to try their mettle
Called him a menace and a freak
Called up a face from long ago
Calls out his nameNo earthly power
Calls up the life she left behind
Came close to grasping at that time
Came due in turn the girls dismay
Came in and took the window chair
Came rushing quickly to surround her
Can Fate indeed be so unkind
Can be excused his rash intentions
Can bring him back the singers gone
Can it be true Eugene reflected
Can it be true its bloom has passed
Can it be true my heydays ended
Can one not love our native Moscow
Can she have found the final clue
Can she have solved the riddles power
Can still produce a lovely flutter
Can tell the time without great fuss
Can that be he It is I say
Can that be she  It seems    and yet  
Can this be real Scarce more than swaddler
Can you so strong of mind and heart
Cant see her fields and valleys glisten
Capricious   spleen in a note to the stanza Pushkin comments archly The whole of this ironical stanza is nothing but a subtle compliment to our fair compatriots Thus Boileau under the guise of reproach eulogizes Louis XIV Our ladies combine enlightenment with amiability and strict purity of morals with that Oriental charm which so captivated Mme de Stal See Dix ans dexil
Capricious belles of lofty station
Caricatures of those he saw
Casts only spleen and languid sadness
Catching the scent the road horse quivers
Central to any consideration of Pushkins art is his novel in verse Eugene Onegin a work unique in Russian literature and one with few if any parallels outside it Although it occupies in some respects an isolated and idiosyncratic place in Pushkins uvre it is also his most deeply characteristic creation It was his own favourite among his works and may well be his greatest single contribution to world literature Despite its considerable

Confronted with an evident inability to render a work faithfully in either its absolute form or its total sense the translator it would seem faces an impossible task and is condemned by the very nature of his enterprise to an act of compromise and betrayal The only solution it seems to me is for the translator to try to view the work not as a hopeless dichotomy but as a unified whole and to try to be faithful in some mysterious spirit to this vision of wholeness In the result perhaps we can honour if nothing else the poor

EUGENE ONEGIN
EXCERPTS FROM ONEGINS JOURNEY
EXPLANATORY NOTES
Each day he rides to take his station
Each day is dear each moment too
Each has his own preoccupation
Each morning early Im awake
Each morning through the park and grounds
Each moves his setting shifts his chair
Each pair a blur in quick succession
Each pane a fragile pattern showing
Each passing hour more captivated
Each to his own or so they say
Each with a different dogma girded
Each year they promised as before
Eight rubbers and eight times as well
Elated by the musics bouncing
Elle tait fille elle tait amoureuse
Emits a yawn and snores again
Enchanted land There for a season
Enchanted with each passing pleasure
Enchanting creatures that entreat
Enchanting yet so fraught with trouble
Encouraged though by Olgas smile
Endowed with bright perfections glow
Enlightenment has failed to mend us
Enough Clearsouled and far from wasted
Enough The burdens off my shoulder
Enough get up To you I owe
Enough now Sing of something more
Enough old boy my ears are ringing
Enrich the slumbering hearts dull load
Entreaties vows pretended fears
Escape unscathed  the slippery devil
Especially since the local wine
Estranged from men and discontented
Eugene Onegin A Novel in Verse by Alexander Pushkin Translated from the Russian with a Commentary New York  iv 
Eugene alone could see his worth
Eugene and I had both decided
Eugene and he recalled the jesting
Eugene detesting litigation
Eugene devised a few concessions
Eugene fell down before her kneeling
Eugene had kept his silent air
Eugene in sudden chill despairs
Eugene of course had keen perceptions
Eugene once left to contemplation
Eugene stared down at Lensky shaken
Eugene stood lost in pensive dreaming
Eugene throws wide the door revealing
Eugene to speak of him again
Eugene who loved the youth at heart
Eugene whod fled their wild abuses
Eugene with friendly condescension
Eugene with secret malice grinning
Eugene would hear his views intently
Even by the standards of his time and circle Pushkins appetite for dissipation was large He was an inveterate gambler and a famous seducer of women behaviour that he was reluctant to relinquish not merely out of a mindless adoption of available social roles but because of the special powers that he attributed to chance and sensuality in his creative life His youthful anacreontic verse with its playful eroticism several narrative poems of refined ribaldry and his more mature love poetry all testify to a deeply sensual nature and his passion for gambling figures prominently in some of his finest prose works He was always fascinated on behalf of his art in the play of the fortuitous in the luck of the draw in the creative possibilities of lifes contingencies He was willing as man and artist to trust in chance to submit to it as the mechanism that while it might condemn him to an outwardly undefined and precarious existence would also assure his inner artistic freedom and his poetic destiny Chance in Pushkins view was the servant of the greater thing that he called fate and his reverence for fate as the ultimate shaper of human destinies haunts his work at almost every stage of his career Essentially buoyant and optimistic in his youth perceiving fate as the artists benign and essential guide he would never distrust it not even when later in his life it took on an ominous and threatening aspect Opposition to the tyranny of human institutions was an essential element in Pushkins conception of the free artist but resistance to fate he believed was a perilous course of action for any individual for himself he was convinced it was the surest way to destruction as a poet These elements of Pushkins characterhis sensuality his courting of chance and his trust in fateare essential clues to his artistic nature and to his conception of creativity He is an artist for whom personality means little for whom an ordinary human nature and a mundane existence are the very attributes and signs of the poet who is fully engaged with life and at the same time receptive to the designs of Providence
Evoked his pity more than anger
Evokes some pity for my woe 
Exalted tender boldly wrought
Examine her from head to toe
Except of course ourselves alone
Except the seas incessant sound
Except to charm her thirsting soul
Exile Stanford Ca  Shaw J d The Letters of Alexander Pushkin Bloomington Ind  Pushkins Rhymes Madison Wis 
Exile seems to have been a defining experience of Pushkins young manhood He deeply resented his enforced absence from the social scene yet he gained through his distance from the centre of events a clearer vision of the society he craved to rejoin When he was permitted eventually to reside once again in St Petersburg and Moscow he quickly set about to reestablish his nonconformist credentials indulging once more in a dissipated style of life although it now seemed less appropriate to his advancing years Even after his marriage at almost  when he had ostensibly settled down he continued to provoke outrage antagonism and even ridicule with his endless literary feuds his increasingly touchy pride in his ancient lineage and his utter contempt for the circles of the court Yet another cause for the contradictory impulses of his spirit was the black African strain in his ancestry a heritage that he saw as both a source of uniqueness and a mark of his alienation from the society whose acceptance he simultaneously rejected and craved At times he revelled in his African strangeness and spoke of his moorish features as the emblem of an elemental and primordial side of his identity while on other occasions he lamented the racial characteristics that set him apart from those around him In any case whatever his ambivalences it seems clear that Pushkin relished as well as resented his estrangement from society and certainly his marginal position in it helped him to see all the triviality and hypocrisy of the monde If he continued to live by its codes he also studied it keenly as an artist and depicted it matchlessly in his work
Expect the rhyme so take itRose
Expecting he would soon appear
Express himself and even write
Express not pain but deaths intrusion
Extinguished ashes wont rekindle
Exulting in anticipation
Eye Tanya with a priggish frown
Fair crystal of my soul and key
Fair summers days and careless treasures
Falls silent fast Alone the chorus
Falls silent in anticipation
Far from the Rome his heart embraced
Far more than some who part this life
Far off Tatyana ranged in dreaming
Fare thee well and if for ever Still for ever fare thee well
Farewell  golden games illusion
Farewell celestial beautys home
Farewell fond nature where I flourished
Farewell my freedom deeply cherished
Farewell my peaceful home and fate
Farewell my peaceful vales and fountains
Farewell now scene of fame unsteady
Farewell secluded place of hiding
Farewell you too familiar mountains
Farewell you too my moody neighbour
Fat Pustyakv the local charmer
Fate watched Eugene in his dependence
Faublas disciple and his tool
Feel frightened tooso let it go
Felt all his old ennui awaken
Felt far from happy with his role
Filled with his hearts regrets and leaning
Finally let me express once again my indebtedness to the previous translators of Pushkins poem Vladimir Nabokovs work in particular was a constant challenge to strive for greater accuracy and his extensive commentary on the novel was an endless source of both instruction and pleasure I want also to express my gratitude to Oxford University Press for giving me in this second edition of my translation the opportunity to revise the text and to add to it the verse fragments on Onegins Journey that Pushkin appended to his novel I should like also to repeat my thanks to Professor Lauren Leighton of the University of Illinois at Chicago for his considerable support and encouragement and to my colleague John Osborne for patiently reading all those early drafts and for urging me when my energy waned to continue with a restless ingenuity My wife Eve has been a sharp but always partial critic To all those including those unnamed who have helped to improve
Finds even joy at times excessive
Fine china bronzesall displayed
Fir forest hedgehog night and snow
First floated dimly into sight
First off hed been at fault last night
Five paces more while Lensky waited
Five versts or so from Krasnogory
Flit softly through this lucent night
Fly to the Nevas water then
For I have known too well the witless
For Im not worthy of them all
For Mother Winters happy pranks
For Richardson was simply mad
For Satan treats all love as play
For after all he couldnt drain
For all lies veiled in misty dust
For all the cares of love again
For all those haunts that I once knew   
For all to see or on the sly
For all your gifts and all your joys
For argument or food for thought
For books had vanished as we know
For but one moment held temptation
For country calm and lack of strife
For country freedom too possesses
For customs rule oer man prevails
For dreams and youth theres no returning
For empty glitter fuss and noise
For every social admonition
For fashions change and views will vary
For fate took matters into hand
For few will understand you so
For fleeting fame I do not weep
For fooling clever men completely
For forty years had heaved his sighs
For fun for dreaming for the heart  
For hair and teeth and fingernail
For hearty talk at evenfall
For hed become so fully jaded
For her confessions of romance
For him enchantments deep infection
For its sake once I squandered gladly
For jibes   and all his foul dominion
For just my books the simple joys
For just one day seek youth again
For kneeling Moscows hand to tender
For loathesomeness of soula clown
For long    forever In his train
For long enough Congratulation
For love offends these charming ladies
For luxury for modish pleasure
For marriage bonds or wedding bell
For me to struggle at this hour 
For my poor hero well adjourn
For my sad lot its share of splendour
For naturefond of contradictions
For now theyll seek accommodation
For nowadays in our great nation
For one may be a man of reason
For other colder dreams I nurse
For otherwise grown bored with pleasure
For otherwise some mocking reader
For pain and grief as well as pleasures
For placid comfortand to last
For private and for other debts
For raising journalistic clamour
For rhyme saw fit to resurrect it
For rooting in the ancient dust
For rural cunning isnt dead
For scrutiny no less irate
For several days she couldnt find
For several minutes in succession
For she in spite of family feeling
For she was bored by all their noise
For six whole weeks it happens yearly
For starters tell me if Im wrong
For storms and feasts and worldly noise
For strange and simple tongues instead
For that small churchyards shaded bowers
For their sweet flow of revelation
For there at heart I feel persuaded
For this delicious epithet
For this may all be mere illusion
For this your ardent spirit pined
For thus our giddy race gains power
For trumpeting its happy lot
For two full days he was enchanted
For two full hours then quite late
For two whole weeks to see my kin
For which no spring will come in truth
For which of them the grave lay waiting
For whom Tatyana is it meant
For whom but darkness lies ahead
For whom these sighs your lyre raises
For winter Then in January
For your sake smothered all my dreams
Forebodings filled and pressed her heart
Foretells a death to come ere long
Forever hounded and reviled
Forever modest meek in bearing
Forever parted from her side
Forgetting then the citys splendour
Forgive me but its true you know
Forgotten in his wretched dwelling
Forlorn and drifting snowbanks stand
Four fateful steps The space decreasing
Four years consumptive sad to note
From Goethes and from Schillers hands
From Gottingen with soulful yearning
From Istanbul the seasides wares
From all that I had ever cherished
From avid lips that press them so
From bathhouse roof to wash enraptured
From bed to icy bath he wanders
From boxes rising row on row
From cellar store has just now come
From dream to dream a passage brief
From early youth she read romances
From eighteeneight with tattered pages
From every Moscow fop and Circe
From frontside backside in between
From head to toe the slightest strain
From here he watched immersed in thought
From jealous critics fearing trouble
From misty Germany our squire
From old Anisya Next day then
From pangs of jealous agitation
From porch to yard to garden straight
From shipboard looming into sight
From some quite gentlemanly distance
From those backwoods And he directed
From two to thirty at the top
From walls ancestral portraits glowered
From where the smug and worthless sit
F
Galop mazurka waltz    And there
Gay magpies on the lawn outside
Give up a role when its outdated
Go on about their special aura
Go ride the steppes harsh open spaces
God grant his mortal soul salvation
God grant that in my careless art
God spare me from the apparition
Goes out of us when youth is dead
Gone blind with tears in full submission
Gone numb with terror Tanya shivers   
Gone silent and forever dark
Good God man dont you find it wearing
Good God man wheres your second Where
Good Petushkv to Olga bounds
Good friends no less than ardent foes
Good gracious how the years do fly
Good night Shes now alone Alls still
Good reasoned talk was also heard
Goodbye Onegin    time I went
Grande Dame of lofty social spheres
Great balconies and monasteries
Great charm to private conversation
Great heaps of straw from threshing mowers
Great wealth and rank and reputation
Green meads and golden cornfields lay
Grey clouds against a sky that lowers
Griboedov
Grow flustered when she saw his coach
Guffawing barking whistles claps
Guillots to fetch the pistol case
Gulnares proud singer his example
Gvozdin Buynov Petushkv
Gvozdin as well that model farmer
Had I in any way desired
Had Lensky known the deep emotion
Had called you out in fiery pride
Had carried back the fruits of art
Had choked her maiden breast too much
Had cordial hopes that hed acquire
Had crowded deep within his heart
Had cursed the cook in useless ire
Had ever so engrossed a maid
Had hungered for the fatal food
Had long since set Eugene to groaning
Had pictures of domestication
Had reached the age of twentysix
Had seized him by the collar then
Had someone else for whom she pined
Had stirred his soul since early days
Hague  Kodjak A and Taranovsky K eds Alexander Pushkin A
Half drowsing
Half humorous half pessimistic
Has been decreed I may have merely
Has brought defective steeds to sell
Has come and brought his portly wife
Has flown to Tanyas in his need
Has flown to someone else instead
Has forced young boughs I must admit
Has lasted thirty centuries long
Has lulled her wretchedness to sleep
Has my Eugene directly hastened
Has never been expressed in Russian
Has opened up his windowtrap
Has overpraised these haughty things
Has painted us the snow newlaid
Has pictured with a single grace
Has so designed the human heart
Has still not mastered postal prose
Has struck at last the poet stops
Has withered with the rising sun
Has withered withered now at last
Have all become mere comic urges
Have asked him to a grand soire
Have been expecting only oysters   
Have brought you to my feet What blindness
Have done with all your lamentations
Have drawn from love abundant themes
Have eaten drunk grown bored and stout
Have filled the house whole congregations
Have gone in quarantine today
Have known poor Tanya from the past
Have not those creatures you adore
Have other maidens gained your places
Have patience friends I beg you pray
Have quit the Muses married soundly
Have read her tortured heart at last
Have scarcely taken cups in hand
Have seen the Russians tented ranks
Have withered with each passing day
Have your fling my dear ones do 
He barely hid his angry look
He began his career in an era when both the writers and the readers of literature belonged almost exclusively to the limited
He bowed to her in silence grave   
He calls a sleigh as daylights dimming
He ceased to know infatuation
He chose with trembling hand to pen
He climbs aboard and off they go
He could have shown some spark of feeling
He could its true from twenty paces
He crammed his bookshelf overflowing
He craves her pardon so completely
He destined Olga for my wife
He did at last give up his love
He did exempt from condemnation
He did possess the happy forte
He did respect a noble few
He didnt die or lose his reason
He died at middays break from labour
He died too soon  his death courageous
He draped a linen mourning shroud
He draws sweet views of rustic scenery
He drinksall drink and all grow shrill
He drives to Nevsky Boulevard
He drives to bed from last nights ball
He dropped you too in sudden fashion
He enters in some apprehension
He enters like a dead man striding
He enterscork and bottle spout
He entertained with fond illusions
He even read some Russians too
He fed on hopes eternal ration
He fell in love with dark seclusion
He felt a restless vague ambition
He felt it break with desperate grieving
He fills her albums fleeting pages
He fled their noisy congregations
He found he couldnt She enquired
He found much wrong in his position
He found the manor fairly bustling
He frownsand all of them grow still
He gave a ball some three times yearly
He gave the message one quick reading
He gives a signthe others hustle
He got so lost in his depression
He had sufficient Latin training
He has no voice Without a smile
He has to have the latest word
He honoured too in tears and pain
He inwardly began to draw
He isnt here Im not expected   
He just about went mad I fear
He just moved off    Hes turning round
He kept consulting watch and sun   
He knew a kindred soul was fated
He knew one constant source of dreaming
He lacked its true all predilection
He laughsthey all guffaw and bustle
He lay quite still and past all feeling
He lays a hand as in confusion
He leaves abruptly calls for horse
He left his home in disillusion
He left the rout in all its splendour
He lived he breathed one single dream
He lives in Moscow This December
He locked himself within his den
He looked the poet so completely
He loved good merry disputations
He loved me and for me he gave
He loves you so    Why youre like kin
He married off his son this fall
He might have scaled a lofty height
He never knew to our frustration
He never pictured once not he
He never shamed the happy creature
He noticed nothing took no part
He offered her his arm Despairing
He once again rejects the monde
He opens up a door    Whats there
He pens a lyre    and then a dove
He plants a tender verse that stands
He pours out tunes that effervesce
He praised Odessas gardens greatly
He promised he would come today
He proudly sang with open heart
He quit one sparkling morn and sprinted
He racked his brains and rather thought
He rants at them his eyes turn dread
He read his Gibbon and Rousseau
He reads them out like one possessed
He rings in haste and with a racket
He roamed the world with singing lyre
He sang lifes bloom gone pale and sere
He sang of love by love commanded
He sang of parting and of pain
He sang the rose romantic flower
He scrawled a note he d be delighted
He sees a youth quite still reposing
He sees before him wondrous fair
He sees forgotten foes hed bested
He sees the wilful Terek roaring
He seldom punished any lark
He settled where the former squire
He should have spoken words of healing
He shuts the book and with decision
He sleeps in blissful sheer delight
He slept took coffee in these quarters
He smiled at Lenskys conversation
He sometimes even dares to cover
He sought them out with no elation
He spends each day and night tormented
He spies a stately eagle soaring
He stays beside her when shes seated
He steers her gliding nonchalantly
He swore that hed make Lensky pay
He takes a single glance to measure
He thought shed blush with selfreproach
He took her arm She moved away   
He took up travel for distraction
He treads the ice with care to test  
He trembles hunts for words in vain
He trusted all she did sincerely
He turned at last and vaguely fluttered
He used to banter rather neatly
He waits At last his guest approaches
He waits till the mazurkas through
He was a kind and simple barin
He was no fool and consequently
He was preparedlike any craven
He who can feel is always fleeing
He who has lived as thinking being
He woke to find with some elation
He wrote thuslimply and obscurely
He yawned alike whereer he sat
Hear my confession too I plead
Hed almost reached his eighteenth year
Hed been entranced by Olga growing
Hed been till now uncertain   restive
Hed better leave without delay
Hed borne enough in former years
Hed calland right away discussion
Hed drink his coffee sometimes sample
Hed earned a certain reputation
Hed furnish his beloved child
Hed hear mid hum and hush alike
Hed lectured gravely on desire
Hed only teased her with some flirting
Hed plunged in mud from Kalmuk steed
Hed shared her frolics with affection
Hed sit at clavichord intently
Hed spent some time with him with pleasure
Hed swim across this Hellespont
Her Moscow cousin Princess Laura
Her bosom heaves her cheeks are burning
Her bow was calm and dignified
Her breathing stops all sense is gone
Her brimming eyes could hardly see
Her cheeks retain their blazing glow
Her cherished trove of tears and bliss
Her dream disturbs her and not knowing
Her ears resound with ringing cries
Her eyes have opened    seen his face
Her face would pale her teeth would chatter
Her father was a kindly fellow
Her fiancagainst her will
Her flaxen curls her lovely smile
Her flowers novels daily labours 
Her gaze upon his face still lingers
Her gentle soul athirst with aching
Her happy dreams have animated
Her head bent down in modest fashion
Her head is bowed as if shes dozing
Her health her calm the smile she wore
Her heart as if in awful fashion
Her heart consumed with lasting anguish
Her heart is rent in two by grief
Her heart speaks out in urgent fashion
Her hero    who was none the less
Her husband at the time was still
Her husband clubman come whatever
Her husband enters thus arresting
Her lancer had to join his troop
Her languid and abstracted air
Her light chemise has slipped exposing
Her lips express determination
Her long unloosened braids of hair
Her lordly ranks commanding ways
Her lovely shoulder to the night
Her lowered eyes aflame the while
Her maiden dreams had helped unfetter
Her manner stayed the same outside
Her morning tea upon a tray
Her mournful air her touching valour
Her portrait there its charming true
Her pounding heart began to race
Her prim conceited face alight
Her rapid dazzling dancing feet
Her rustic charms on full display
Her same old spouse and same old pooch
Her secret passions and her dreams
Her share of travels dull delights
Her shoulders face and breast With dread
Her simple open country heart
Her sister bore the name Tatyana
Her skyblue eyes devoid of guile
Her slender form fierce cackles sound
Her soul awaited   someones touch
Her soul despite herself infected
Her soul unmoved grows wan and sickly
Her stormy scenes and wails aloud
Her stricken face When all came out
Her summer in the country mending
Her tears well up without a word
Her virgin brooding once had cherished
Her voice her form her graceful stance
Her voice more soft than reed pipes humming
Her walks were long a brook or knoll
Her weariness and helpless languor
Her worth yet cursing fate unduly
Her younger sister married neatly
Here practised dandies bow and slither
Heres Petushkv the district fop
Heres Pradt or better Walter Scott
Hes brought some news to set them cheering
Hes ever constant ever novel
Hes ever near In gloomy weather
Hes gulled the world    now let it go
Hes happy just to be around her
Hes happy now hes almost sane   
Hes hardly worth contempt I know
Hes here But all those faces
Hes master here theres no mistaking
Hes off to Talons late and racing
Hes offthis critic most exacting
Hes past the porter up the stair
Hes quite forgotten us I fear
Hes still an honest chap most surely
Hes urged to seek his doctors view
Hes yours hell say through thick and thin
Himself his dinner and his wife
His Blackie seated on the sled
His French valet Guillot runs in
His aged uncles time was due
His arid vanity exposed
His blend of banter and of bile
His blissful spirit unencumbered
His blood by slow degrees congealing
His chance to mix in this affair
His children at their ABCs
His clothing for the learned set
His cold embittered mind that seems
His collar with its beaver trimming
His daughter read or kept at home
His distant homeland he recalled
His double glass he calmly centres
His dreams and songs all rent asunder
His endless bent for deep reflection
His eyes ablaze Eugene stood waiting
His eyes aflame Onegin rises
His eyes retain their stare but she Sits
His eyes toward the stage and play
His father diedquite unexpected
His father never understood
His father ran up debts galore
His favourite sport or avocation
His feelings and his thoughts went slack
His figure in the lookingglass
His former love of life was dead
His gaze of constant inspiration
His glasses on hed deign to play
His grumbling soul the hours strike
His heart grown deaf to commendation
His heart so full of pain drew tight
His incandescent Olga there
His kinsman and his friend Eugene
His languid brow looked strange at rest
His languid spirits fretful play
His life flowed onquite calm and pleasant
His living tears upon the bed
His look was still a tender dart
His martyred shade condemned to night
His mind still vacillant in reach
His moment of revenge beginning
His mournful life in consecration   
His neighbour calling out to wake him
His neighbour spoke Well then hes dead
His only form of recreation
His only torment toil and treasure
His parents dust   their memorys gladness   
His pen breathes love not pure invention
His pencil marks with special care
His pistol with a level gaze
His pistols then he put them back
His poets soul his artists mind
His riding crop And on she wended
His simple coloured shoes of bast
His slipper or his magazine
His slow advance was first to raise
His sombre wit and biting style
His soul aflame with virgin fire
His soul still knew the warm effusion
His strangeness that was more than seeming
His stricken sick extinguished eyes
His stubborn thrusting horns held low
His tea and rum at once renouncing
His thoughts had wandered far apart
His true ideal and hovered round her
His unexpected reappearance
His very memory now has fled
His views on morals ever mellow
His wedding day two weeks ahead
His wife herself we ought to add
His world a closed and silent door
Hm hm dear reader feeling mellow

Holds but oblivion in the end
Holds shame in savage dread alas

How Tanyas grown It seems my dear
How blest shy lover to be granted
How changed Tatyana is
How deep his stricken heart is shaken
How dull to hear the same objections
How early he could stir or worry
How early on he could dissemble
How keen his glance how bold and tender
How long ago did they warmhearted
How long it took me to forget
How many echoes it imparts
How natures lively renovation
How nobly in a sense you acted
How oft   forlorn and separated
How oft have tearful poets chances
How oft in childhood days
How oft mid far Caucasias glories
How oft within his arms I lay
How often in the summer quarter
How often on the course I charted
How often on the shores of Tauris
How quick shes mastered how securely
How right toward me that awful day
How sad I find your apparition
How sad is faded passions trace   
How sad that youth with all its power
How selfoblivious he could seem
How sensuous her wondrous gazes   
How shrewdly he could be inventive
How surely Shes taken up the role she plays
How wicked spleen had once before
How wrong Ive been And how tormented
However dazzling to the sight
However great her shock or strain
However much I loved you dear
However much the situation
However reader we may wonder  
Huge horns and bony fingers swerving
Hussars on leave come racing hither
I ask you now to tell me truly
I cannot resurrect my soul
I cant remember much of late
I cant though readers help but care
I cant translate this phrase I find
I close I dare not now reread    
I couldnt even count them all
I couldnt sleep   nurse its stifling
I dared not trust in love again
I daresay betterlooking too
I didn t yield to sweet temptation
I dont know why but in the end
I drag about like some poor laggard
I envision In opening my soul to you
I even now would worship balls
I face another complication
I fall anointed
I fear And nowadays I find more pleasing
I fear that in this meek petition
I fear that lingonberry brew
I feel her breath upon my face
I find a faultless Russian style
I find their friendship much too dear
I first tried silence and evasion 
I gave my word but Lord
I get confused    But tell me nanny
I give it here in feeble dress
I give myself to harmless pleasures
I got so scared    my tears kept falling
I have no leisure for retailing
I have of old relied upon
I have them and I quote them here
I hear the ring of glass and cup
I hope we part in satisfaction  
I hope youll stay Dear cousin Laura
I know that gentle Parnys lays
I know that in your heart reside
I know that youll agree my reader
I know youll feel a deep distress 
I lack the strength for true repentance
I like a sandy slope of late
I liked his caustic disputation
I liked his natural bent for dreaming
I liked his ways and we made friends
I liked it once no less than you
I live I writenot seeking fame
I lived back then in dry Odessa  
I long for peace for simple fare
I lost my way and recollected
I love my dear Tatyana so
I love their feetalthough youll find
I love you why should I dissemble
I love you with a tender yearning
I love youths wanton fevered madness
I married   
I might describe in terms more knowing
I might have found who knows another
I must have known a thousand pages
I need And I submit to it securely
I need to know when I awaken 
I plead with tears upon my face 
I pray May I not roam too far astray 
I pray you heed my sound advice
I read a little often sleep
I read it with an ache inside me
I recollect the ocean rumbling
I roam the shore await fair weather
I scare a flock of ducks from resting
I search on all the paths I wander
I shed with you sweet tears too late
I shrink with shame and fear 
I sing a youthful friend of mine 
I sing strange whims and aberrations 
I spent my days of deepest bliss
I start upon an untrod way
I swear I dont know what to do
I take a stroll Inciting urges
I think I must be dreaming dear   
I thought in freedom peace of mind
I thought she might accept him then
I too had parted with convention
I too have elected in my version to preserve what I could of Pushkins form taking the Onegin stanza as one of the novels most essential and characteristic features the buildingblock with which the entire edifice is constructed By retaining the stanza form that Pushkin uses as his poetic paragraph the translator positions himself in a sense on the works home ground and imposes upon himself a useful discipline for his journey Furthermore he is thereby constrained as was the poet himself to seek solutions without selfindulgence to find variety within oneness and to earn freedom within the bondage of the form The very rigidity of the stanzaic structure can bring at times a fruitful tension to the words with which the form is made manifest and the economy of expression it enforces upon the translator will sometimes reward him with an unexpected gift
I too have gazed in rapt attention
I too there used to saunter forth
I tore away my grieving heart
I tremble with malicious glee
I turned to flame I felt all shaken 
I used to meet with now and then
I vow Has ever had and hasnt now
I vow Retracting it would suit me better
I wait for you    and your decision 
I wanted with Albanis glory
I was embittered he depressed
I watch with jealous trepidation
I wont be long    just leave the taper
I would have asked youyes its true
I would have wished a finer treasure
I wouldnt say that ladies never
I write   and want no more embraces
INTRODUCTION
Id be alone now    leave me nurse
Id choose the elder one instead
Id grieve to quit this worlds dim light
Id have you with your art refashion
Id much prefer words harsh and chill
Id not have known you then at all
Id play
Id sip my Turkish coffee sweet
Id swear its from some novels pages
Idol mio Idol mio piu pace non ho My idol I have peace no longer the refrain from a duet by Vincenzo Gabussi 
If art holds a mirror up to nature it frequently does soas in this masterpiece of Pushkinsby first directing that mirror at other works of art The world of Eugene Onegin derives perhaps as much from Western European literary antecedents and traditions as it does from its authors Russia and in doing so it provides a paradoxical picture of life mimicking art The literary translator in seeking to participate in this international colloquy holds as it were yet another mirror up to these already doubled or tripled mirrors It is a devilish and tricky business this game in a house of mirrors this effort to catch and reflect elusive reflections There are occasions when the translator however carefully he tries to grip his own mirror by its edges so as not to smudge the glass will inadvertently allow his hands to enter the picture and thus obscure the view
If her prim tomcat sat protected
If with your pistol youd struck down
If you recall your Tanya still
If you were with me still my friend
Ignored our journals all too gladly
Ignoring reasons condemnation
Ihear at last your magic voice
Ileave your world of quiet joys
Ill bet Onegin woke at dawn
Ill cease one day to be a poet
Ill corner him and catch his coat
Ill die she whispers to the dawn
Ill finish up another day
Ill float in gondolas seclusion
Ill give a fathers simple greetings
Ill glance at house and garden plot
Ill grant the censors right to shine
Ill make them quarrel yet again
Ill never know But none the less
Ill never let that foul depraver
Ill say without wroughtup insistence
Ill see this Phyllis so provoking
Ill see you in the day ahead
Ill show the childrens secret meetings
Ill sprinkle you with holy water
Ill take the letter never fear
Ill tell it all in detailed style
Ill think up speeches tenderhearted
Illumined sadly by Diana
Ilonged to join the waves in pressing
Im    you know nurse  in love not ill
Im duelling with a friend of mine
Im fond of friendly conversation
Im good for nothing now I fear
Im grateful now in every way   
Im happy love    its true you know
Im not quite in the mood just now
Im notWell then why not tonight
Im old my mind  it does get muddled
Im on the verge of tears and wailing
Im sick at heart and all upset
Im sure youll find him most engaging
Im sure youve known provincial misses
Im thinking of Onegin love
Im trying hard to pay attention
Im weeping    Oh at this late hour
Im writing you this declaration
Im young and still robust you see
Immersed in gloom beyond recall
Immersed in thickly oozing muck
Immobile mute and cherubfaced
Immodestly Id seek to borrow
Impassioned days and idle hours
Impatient but in no great panic
Implacable to all resistant
Implored me and in resignation
Imploring aspect mute replies
Imported pipes of Turkish amber
Impossible for mind to know
In Chapter One if you recall
In French he could and did acutely
In Lafontaines insipid manner
In Mother Earth where hes at rest
In Muslim paradise complete
In Olgas breast What shoulders too
In album drawings all through town
In all her schemes hed never probe
In all the cups without a sound
In all the sterile words they use
In all this world whats more perverted
In ancient hall or modern flat
In anguish with his heart forsaken
In anguished writhing almost manic
In any case heres my advice
In any novelyoull discover
In arid gossip questions news
In attempting to reproduce poetry the verbal art most closely tied to its native language and the most susceptible to distortion in the transfer to another the translator faces particularly vexing difficulties Verse perhaps can be translated great poetry is something else Russian and English poetry do not look sound or behave very much alike and by choosing to work on Pushkins poem in which the sheer beauty of sound is so vital a part of its effect and in which all the expressive resources of the Russian language are on masterful display the translator may find himself casting an uneasy eye at Robert Frosts cautionary definition of poetry as what gets lost in translation All he can do having begun is keep to his task reassuring himself that both Russian and English after all assemble consonants and vowels into sounds and words into beauty and sense
In bed beneath her silken curtain
In bonnets and malignant poses
In both his poetry and his prose Pushkin was a profound innovator He brought to its successful conclusion the revolt against the tenets of French neoclassicism which with its rigid divisions and classifications of genres had dominated the literature of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries Life in Pushkins view was wilder and more various than these conventions would allow and although he always retained a rather classical respect for balance and proportion in art he introduced into his native literature a new sense of artistic freedom His formal experiments encouraged a vigorous
In bottle with the pitch still clinging
In cherished dreams I sometimes stand
In crosses or a jotted note
In current fashions of toilette
In dancing too his step was light
In days of dreams and dissipations
In days when I still bloomed serenely
In deaf eternitys grim shade
In dim Moldavias vacant waste
In dry Odessaso said I I might have said
In duels a purist doctrinaire
In early youth hed been the prey
In fact   Good Lord my wits are bleak
In fiery dust before her eye
In following where pleasure calls
In girlish pranks but grisly stories
In glasses and a torn old coat
In heavens peaceful desert flying
In hired coach towards the ball
In hopes that he on charge might squeeze
In just her cap and quilted gown
In just such albums friends I too
In liveried ranks whereer she calls
In love with Tanya like a boy
In maidens albums thought it keen
In mans attire to pay a call
In missives writ in loves defence
In mud waisthigh the houses snuggle
In noisy haste the throng departs
In our backwoods as youll allow
In our day too lets not forget
In pale blue shafts from chimney ends
In pallid swarms the patients press
In passing that I speak as much
In passing though one observation
In philosophical seclusion
In pleasant hubbub morns awaking
In pledge of beauty and of good
In pledge of meeting you my friend 
In praise of him who made the world
In public speaks a word or two
In quick succession silhouettes
In quite a keen oldfashioned way
In racing droshkies bound for pleasure
In russet wig and fine pincenez
In sad Moldavia she turned tender
In saturnine romanticism
In savage glee all eyes turn round
In search of pleasures sweet profusion
In sheepskin coat and scarlet sash
In silence Moscows youthful graces
In silence at the window bay
In silence to destroy each other   
In silence to instruct the fair
In silver curves begins to gleam
In some old tattered almanac
In something somehow have we not
In springtime on the meadows green
In such a burst of moral fire
In such an honest artless fashion
In summer hed get up by seven
In sunsets glow the murky light
In swirls about the china pot
In taking joy while loving not
In talk of Olga Loves a bore
In tattered nightcap and his vest
In that brief instant then who couldnt
In that forsaken distant place
In them though nothing ever alters
In these odd lines of my invention
In this case though one has to say
In this forgotten country dwelling
In this serene and gloryladen
In time I promise Ill not fail
In time he might have changed profoundly
In toast to his attractive neighbour   
In trade for tallow and for trees
In uniform The one not talking  
In vain my searching eyes enquire
In wavy carpets glistening bright
In wedlock we would both be broken
In what grim desert madman banished
In what new guise is he returning
In which a maiden heart had wept
In which our age is well displayed
In whose bright company Ive known
In winter when the shade of night
In winter with the hearth before it
In working over quite a few years on several visions and revisions of this translation I have found myself searching for an ever more natural and unforced flow of language for a more fluid and straightforward syntax a lighter and more readily comprehensible style I have tried to avoid as much as possible
In your imported coach I pray
In your slim tracks Ill stray no more
Incessantly the serpent calls
Inconstancy grew too fatiguing
Indeed the poets fervent speech
Indifferent to admirers roses
Indifferent to the views they hold
Inhale the frostdust gather snow
Inow mix water with my wine
Inside her hut a girl is singing
Inside her stormy passions seething
Inside itall is hushed and stark
Inside our Lyce garden wall
Inside that modish bachelor cell
Inside the pans Screwed fast to metal
Instead her silken sash untying
Instead of bristling like a beast
Instructs his man as well to hurry
Instructs us in a moral way
Intelligence and handsome face
Into the fields my friends pellmell
Into the open field to gaze
Is Saturday Her mothers sent
Is affectationnothing more
Is always angry sullen mute
Is barren steppeland all around
Is bound by any righteous wife
Is brought in bottle chilled and ready
Is checked relined and soon made fast
Is dressed undressed and dressed again
Is duty free and rather fine
Is first to toast her where he stands
Is gone the snake of recollection
Is half a crane and half a cat
Is he the same or is he learning
Is held in high esteem at Court
Is incoherent rot or worse
Is it because her simple heart
Is it because we never tire
Is it perhaps my new ascension
Is just another lanterns blur
Is just as meek and deaf its true
Is just the trembling moon alas   
Is lacking yet one feature badly
Is neither cold nor too effusive
Is often easy even nice
Is quite alone Some minutes there
Is she in loveWith whom I wonder
Is silver bright with frosted snow
Is sure to fall   and so will you
Is surer far than friends or kin
Is that it friendFar from it Nay
Is this the lot youve been assigned
Is what we like and call our own
Istmina takes up her stand
It called him out and did it well
It came so close   But now my fate
It charmed me too in other days
It fizzes foams and bubbles lightly
It hardly mattered to my friend
It has I know association
It has its contradictions clearly
It hints to probing ardent glances
It hissed and sent its vapour steaming
It may be he was born to fire
It may be now your inclination T
It reawakened Tanyas heart
It speaks to me in words I know
It still retains its pristine joys
It wasnt that shed read him really
It waxes stirs turns seething wave
It wears with pride its recent glory
Italian voices ringing loudly
Ithank you for your host of treasures
Its Lensky    with Eugene Oh dear
Its Lenskys troika three fine roans
Its ancient domes and spires streaming
Its blood ran hot with lifes own heat
Its cold and dark within the dell
Its countless lampions burning bright
Its grey Filtievna whos bringing
Its happy rights  as grand as those
Its hard to bear as you well know
Its hard to face a long succession
Its hatreds hopes and loves still beat
Its legend lets the stranger know
Its loves and hates its joy and sadness
Its magic stream brought forth no end
Its my turn now to make a speech
Its noisy feasts and grand events
Its not your mind Im talking of
Its nothing And away he went
Its nothing nanny be at ease
Its now the British Muses fables
Its pleasant to provoke a foe
Its pleasant when you see him staring
Its sacred to Apollos choir
Its thunder once could even rack
Its time for flowers labours heat
Its time for something new he muttered
Its time its time I bid her hail
Its time my pen demands a pillow Nine cantos have I duly wrought And now the ninth and final billow To joyful shore my bark has brought All praise to you  nine Camenae etc
Its time my sweet to greet the day
Its time she married    awful waste   
Its time that she were settled too
Its time to quit this dreary lee
Its time to rise Past six    come on
Its time will pass without my knife
Its token beauty stokes the fires
Its true The lady didnt shiver
Its true by selfhypnotic action
Its up to me he thought to save her
Its want of purpose is a crime
Its where I find   More pastoral singing
Its wondrous veil to stand uncovered
Its worthlessness needs no professing
Ive closed my eyes to phantoms gleaming
Ive drawn a plan and know whats needed
Ive dreamt of Moscow far away
Ive faith in you and do not tremble
Ive got no strength    this weary breast
Ive got the scene in mind so clearly
Ive known great beauties proudly distant
Ive learned the voice of new desires
Ive looked it over most severely
Ive marvelled at their haughty manner
Ive read your words and they evoke
Ive suffered ballets long enough
Ive talked so long that Ive required
Ivn Petrvich  no more bright
Julia again the character from Rousseaus Julie
Just cabbage soup and room to spare
Just casual friends whod often call
Just killing time that way each night
Just lies in bed without a word
Just like the moon upon her throne
Just looked at himher visage bleak
Just love yourself and ease the pain
Just never mind    now look up there   
Just now though friends I feel too tired
Just picks her up and rushes on
Just plays my stomach false
Just says I cant then broods away
Just send your grandson will you please
Just sits with lowered head remote
Just so The tomb that lies before us
Just so a butterfly both quivers
Just so a casual guest at night
Just so a hare in winter shivers
Just so a sapling sheds its leaf
Just so a soldier old and lame
Just so a youthful rake reflected
Just so in carefree song I paid
Just takes his leave and drives away
Just tell me dearest what you need
Just what the dreadful vision meant

Lel supposedly a pagan Slavic deity of love more likely according to Nabokov merely derived from the chanted refrain of old songs eg the ay lyuli lyuli of many Russian folksongs
Lensky is yet another figure who derives from books Creating himself out of his naive literary readings and aspirations he becomes a gentle parody of the sentimental romantic poet What is particularly interesting and somewhat paradoxical however is that most of the characters transcend their function as parodies They are treated by their creator with a sometimes puzzling blend of ironic detachment and sympathetic concern It is one of the charms of the novel that the author or at least the narrator shares at times the viewpoint and attitudes of his most nave reader
Lest I forget of whom I sing
Lest monde or husband misconstrue
Let Gods own lightning strike you now
Let me close these brief introductory remarks on Pushkins masterwork with a few observations on some of its autobiographical implications It presents among its other texts the writers report to himself at midcareer recording his discoveries about life and art and his concerns for his creative future Not only the novels narrator it should be noted but also the three other major characters are quite clearly expressions of Pushkins personality Onegin despite the authors disclaimer to the contrary bears some of Pushkins own human traits and the two share a number of social masks the essential and decisive difference between them of course is that Onegin has none of the poet in him Lensky on the other hand who does possess a genuine if immature poetic sensibility is not unlike the younger Pushkin a persona the writer has outgrown and now regards with affectionate irony The conflict in the novel between Onegin and Lensky so perplexingly motivated in terms of the characters psychology represents much more plausibly a conflict in the soul of the author a struggle between his prosaic and poetic selves recall the description when the two characters first meet Lensky all poetry Onegin all prose If it seems that Pushkin takes the cynical Onegin rather seriously and merely mocks the naive Lensky this is something of a subterfuge a device to conceal his own passionate commitment even as he questions it to poetry Onegin Pushkins friend is at once his baser alter ego and a symbol of his new allegiance to the truths of prose Tatyana whom the narrator calls his ideal and who by the novels end is identified with Pushkins Muse seems on a symbolic plane to stand as the
Let me repay you with a vow
Let not the poets soul grow bitter
Lets all go have a nice long rest  
Lets go
Lets grant to fevered youthful days
Lets listen to their conversation
Lets prick vainglory first with hope
Lets trace a winding brooklets flow

Lies snoring with his portly partner
Life pulses full as here and there
Lifes essence    and enjoyed my fill
Like Byrons Harold lost in trances
Like Chatsky straight from boat to ball
Like Cypris bathed in mornings light
Like Hippocrene it sparkles brightly
Like Petrarch then he calms the heart
Like ancient foes in mad dissension
Like any poetopen caring
Like convicts sent in dreaming flight

Like down from Eols lips she races
Like drunken Delvig at a fest
Like empty sounds exist no more
Like fair Lenore on moonlit nights
Like fashions very illustration
Like flighty Venus when she chooses
Like giddy hopeso gay and clever
Like him she dressed as taste decreed
Like leaves dank autumn rots away
Like modish verse devoid of reason
Like noble Regulus he bowed
Like shadow or a faithful wife
Like smoke across an azure ocean
Like some grim shade of nights creating
Like spectres in a bleak procession
Like that poor tax collector there
Like verse with prose like flame with fountain
Like you and me to being nice

Much commentary on the work has focused understandably enough on its hero and heroine Onegin and Tatyana the illstarred but nontragic lovers who were to become the prototypes for a host of figures created by later Russian writers Those critics who approach the text as a realistic novel and who accept its heroes as more or less psychologically plausible representatives of their society have viewed the two main characters in quite varied and even conflicting ways To some Onegin is a victim of his environment a potentially creative man whose personal fulfilment is frustrated by the limited opportunities available to him in his era To others he is an antihero an amoral hedonist and misanthropic egoist Tatyana though usually regarded in an almost hagiographic light she is for many Russians the most beloved heroine in their literature also has a few detractors readers who see her as an immature woman in whom instinctual drives and vague intuition rather than active intelligence or innate spiritual nobility account for most of her actions All those critics who attempt such analyses of the characters are confronted by certain puzzling inconsistencies in their behaviour in different parts of the novel they seem almost to be different people A reasonable explanation not much noted for the antithetical interpretations the heroes have evoked is that they are dichotomous in their very natures over the long period of the novels composition Pushkins own artistic values and aims were changing and it seems quite likely that his characters evolved as well that his image of them ripened and deepened over that period There is also a fundamental if rich ambiguity in the authors treatment of Onegin and Tatyana as both characterstudies and poetic symbols
Must be a Mason drinks they say   
Must occupy my pen for now
Mute monument to fond reflection
Muzhiks and merchants Cossack guards
My Tambov poet takes in tow
My Tanya starts to understand
My Tanya though is so forlorn
My Tanyas conquest taking wing
My bold Buynov guides expertly
My countrys honour will demand
My dear Elvina I adore it
My dear one you are doomed to perish
My deep respect for your emotion
My fair Tatyanas noblest trait  
My faith in you and your affection 
My fertile fancies spring to life
My first few stanzas I once read
My fleeting youthful days were spent
My flighty mistress at my side
My former master lived here too
My gentle Muses magic spell
My god How stern that haughty brow
My goddesses You vanished faces
My goodness girl you must be ailing
My heart and tongue once used to soar
My hero and of course I vow
My heros features here with mine
My last poor pence    remember friend
My left But why It seems like gawking
My life till now has been a token 
My lovely lily stalk and blade
My lyre sings And in the gloaming
My mind and will are almost broken 
My most esteemed and honoured reader
My muddled pupil in distraction
My name or breathe a single word   
My novels shape or what would be
My pen has lost its disposition
My poor poor Lensky Yes she mourned him
My present novels Chapter One
My second said Eugene directly
My secret shame had I discerned 
My services to save your houses
My soul cries out and longs to offer
My soul preserved their secret features
My souls a stranger to its call
My span on earth is all but taken 
My sparkling youth before you flee
My spirits own newborn creation
My springtimes golden days so dear
My straying pen no longer traces
My student cell turned incandescent
My stylish house where princes dine
My thanks to you With you Ive tasted
My tribute to the mountain maid
My uncle man of firm convictions   
My word that little devil courted
My youth betrayed its time to show
NOTE ON THE TRANSLATION
Naively poured his secrets out
Napoleon drunk with fresh success
Nasce una gente a cui lmorir non dole
Nay ever more intensely quaking
Near waters sparkling in the still
Nearby St Charitons it ended
Neath flowring cherries and acacias
Neath passions rains they green and thicken
Necker
Neglected bridges rot and fall
Nereids seanymphs daughters of the seagod Nereus
Never come to listen in
Never come to spy on us
Next day as dawn was just advancing
Next day for sure theyd drive at dawn
Night falls the moon begins parading
Nina Voronskya an invented name for a stylized society belle Russian commentators on the poem have suggested various reallife prototypes
No Grandison in Russian dress
No answer came Eugene elected
No cards no balls no poets feats
No fine parquet could hope to muster
No funds on renting fresher horse
No inns exist At posting stages
No jealous lady trained lorgnette
No lasting truths or dissertations
No lines a poet had invented
No longer cheered the family group
No madrigals of mere convention
No maidens lips were equal bliss
No matter childish hope appears
No matter fates decree is just
No matter what he tries to do
No modish connoisseur his glasses
No more at dawn does shepherd need
No never midst the fiercest blaze
No never once did passions flood
No nothing touched his sombre heart
No plaything of the mobs conventions
No rosy cheek that I might kiss
No sapient truths no pretty scenes
No secret crimes or passions gory
No sooner here than he went roaming
No sooner would the cannon sounding
No spot of ink on oaken floors O
No stir disturbs the silence round
No surer place for declarations
No trace at all of last nights fret
No trace of Tanya from the past
No welcome feast did she prepare
Nor Senecas nor Byrons pages
Nor any vulgar gutter verse
Nor bowed her head in subjugation
Nor did he care what secret tome
Nor did he scorn the odd review
Nor does his horn at midday sound
Nor does she put her seals impression
Nor even Fashion Plates Displayed
Nor foreign beauties magic spell
Nor hear the ages bless his days
Nor known this bitter heartaches swelling
Nor pleasures rounds nor learnings well
Nor read its novels final pages
Nor scorned the social mobs decisions
Nor see that noxious worm devour
Nor wanton sighs nor tender glances
Nor was it that she much preferred
Nor watch this twoday blossom fade
Nor yet the Muse his true vocation
Not aiming yet the foes took boldly
Not daring once to steal away
Not even in some chance remark
Not far from our unhappy maid
Not far from where the youth once flourished
Not once all day does thought but flicker
Not only woe   Its true my dear
Not thinking of the proud worlds pleasure
November marched across the land
Now I beg you go
Now Tanya is alone forsaken
Now all is hushed Tatyana sleeps
Now carried off by fate a bride
Now chatting now a silent guide
Now dont refuse its time you went
Now doomed by death to pass unheard
Now doomed to wither unfulfilled
Now every man has foes in life
Now gazes at the vacant park 
Now greetings come congratulations
Now greets the dawning season brightly
Now homes our heroes destination
Now is the time you hibernators
Now my Eugene Chadyevs double
Now nature tremulous turns pale
Now stoop to play so base a part
Now streams of greyish powder settle
Now tea is brought I like to tell
Now the mazurkas call is sounded
O horrors No shed better stay
O spring   time of loves unrest
OBrenta I shall yet rejoice

Of maidens touch and friendships clasp

Of twisted slanders might combine
Of usage and pronunciation
Of verses I wont even speak

Of whom lifelong the verdict ran

Old X is quite a splendid man
Old age divines with glasses on
Old women beamed as she went by
Oldfashioned Russian welcome treat
Olovely land you shores of Tauris
On Christmas eve he paid a call
On Sundays at his window station
On any theme but our own plight
On balls I madly used to dote
On bivouac then hears with dread
On breast and falls His misted eyes
On coming home the youth inspected
On coming to she looks around her
On dining chairs have bedded gladly
On each in turn theyd ruminate
On every side you seem to find
On former days and times of yore
On gooses neck a skull seemed cheerful
On granting him his resting place
On hackedout bluish ice that lay
On kinfolk and their implications
On ladies he has yet to meet
On leaving some delightful ball
On little dishes her preserves
On meeting her at some dull aunts
On melting snowas if hes dozing
On misty eves she led me down
On my long work as I grow older 
On one whose heart has long been dead
On proper form hed not allow
On rain and flax and cattle care   
On reaching land at last Hurray
On scaring off some timid lover
On soft Italian nights Ill go
On stilts alone can feeble feet
On stormy Zeuss orders clearly
On top of which theyre so unerring
On treacherous ice in blunted shoe
On unknown faces on the stages
On which herewith these observations
On winter nights all dark and cold
On yielding rugs in rich profusion
Once Vyzemsky sat down beside her
Once free I seek again the blending
Once more an idler now he smothers
Once more cant wait till day is past
Once more he counts the hours pacing
Once more he turned to books and sages
Once more imagination surges
Once more in solemn rapt attention
Once more that touch ignites and urges
Once more the love    once more the dart
Once used to you  Id cease I fear
One aims a gun at ducks on high
One constant wish forever gleaming
One couldnt label her a beauty
One craves the scent that war exudes
One dreams of ruling multitudes
One everpresent cause for pain
One foot upon the ground she places
One has a roosters head on top
One is entranced by rhyme as I
One likes to bask in melancholy
One loosened curl with soft caress
One melancholy joker found her
One moment backa breaths duration
One occupies himself with wine
One splendid house is all alight
One swats at flies in mindless folly
One thought within his heart enfolds him
One worthy of your souls perfection
Onegin I was then much younger
Onegin OhAnd light as air
Onegin dressing in a flurry
Onegin fired The hour fated
Onegin kept his stallion ready
Onegin late made explanation
Onegin lifts an arm to rout
Onegin lived in his own heaven
Onegin mid those mournful crowds
Onegin noting Lenskyd left
Onegin now has left the scene
Onegin pausing thought of me
Onegin sits amid the roar
Onegin snatches up a knife
Onegin stares at her intently
Onegin stares with all his soul
Onegin taking it withdrew
Onegin then while still not ceasing
Onegin though is fading quickly
Onegin turned to Lensky next Shall we begin
Onegin was profoundly stirred
Onegin was so some decided
Onegin wasting has the air
Onegin who was widely taken
Onegin with his first reaction
Onegins Letter to Tatyana
Onegins taste in horse and coach
Onegins uncle sick and dying
Ongin my good friend and brother
Only the sound of sentries calling
Onto the porch and fussed about
Or Cleopatra with his jeers
Or Edens joys for us are moot
Or Freischutz played with timid skill
Or God forbid some wretched breeder
Or Veuve Cliquot the finest class
Or all the passions they inspire
Or am I now inured to gladness
Or arm in arm they make their rounds
Or arrow passes byalls right
Or as a sad and raving creature
Or as more tenderly Id say
Or blush or suddenly turn white  
Or borrow thenfrom me lets say
Or brawling boy to take offence
Or brings her smothered tears relief
Or chanced upon the sad affair
Or check accounts Youd rather not
Or chill corruptions deadly grasp
Or cunningly start altercations
Or did the time of tears soon pass
Or do we mark with lamentation
Or does he play the outcast still
Or else  or else    may God defend you
Or else and here Im far from jesting
Or else hed patch things up between them
Or else turned poet an obsession
Or even Demon of my pen
Or even let an eyebrow quiver
Or fetch her kerchief when it falls
Or floating on the drowsy river
Or for the passing of a note
Or frighten with despairing tongue
Or games of tag upon the heather
Or gloomy Melmoth lost and pleading
Or go on dropping words of wit
Or had Tatyana had some notion
Or had a happy fate required
Or halt this heavy dream of mine
Or harden and congeal alone
Or heard approaching uninvited
Or hells own demon of temptation
Or hint of inner lyric grace
Or if amid the fields one day
Or if she happened anywhere
Or if unconsciously or not
Or if upon her left shed spy
Or in a grave dispute hed wear
Or in the question mark he wrote
Or judge yourself how it must look
Or kiss the border of her dress
Or laugh it off and through some ruse
Or lulled by Lethe has he slumbered
Or manufactures for delight
Or maybe he was merely fated
Or maybe hes just dedicated
Or maybe merely faulty grammar
Or passed unpunished or unheeded
Or passes by without a greeting
Or perched on granite by the shore
Or plaintive horn would make us shiver
Or press her lips together tight
Or saddened by the reemergence
Or scholar in a yellow shawl
Or see the Russian muse of dance
Or seek some other sweet employment
Or send a wish by mail at least
Or shall my mournful gaze alight
Or so at least with joy he thought
Or some young girl from town whos spending
Or sometimes Idol mio sweetly
Or sometimes after dinners dreary
Or sometimes merely bows on meeting
Or sparkled in one way or other
Or sparkling wit as cold as prose
Or stand the sound of friendly chatter
Or suddenly from Million Street
Or sultry breast on which to languish
Or tell them all the city news
Or that I now have wealth and rank
Or that by morn theyd be debating
Or that my husband maimed in battle
Or through the magic crystal see
Or trying gravely to convince
Or turn a poet in despair
Or turned to heaven softly crying
Or use those sorts of affectation
Or verse that Bogdanvich wrote
Or was he profligate and hale
Or what if he himself not thinking
Or when I helped the poor and dying
Or when a shooting star flew by
Or where hed tacitly agreed
Or where the husband knowing truly
Or why am I not old and spare
Or why not crippled with arthritis
Or will he sport some other mask
Or would my fall perhaps be sport

P A Katenin whose fine poetic talent in no way prevents him from being a subtle critic as well has observed to us that this excision though advantageous perhaps for the reader is none the less harmful to the work as a whole for it makes the transition from Tatyana the provincial miss to Tatyana the exalted lady too sudden and unexplained an observation that reveals the accomplished artist The author himself felt the justness of this reproach but decided to omit the chapter for reasons important to him but not to the public Some few excerpts have been published already we insert them here along with several other stanzas
PUSHKINS FOREWORD
Parny EvaristeDsir de Parny  French poet famed for the elegance of his love poetry His Posies erotiques influenced Russian poetry of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
Passed on in bed  his children round
Past diplomats and soldierfops
Past garden plots small bridges lawn
Past gateway lions lifted paws
Past seedbeds to the brookso fast
Past towers hovels boulevards
Past urchins streetlamps strolling fops
Paved highways linking every side
Pelting him with cherries then 
Perceive full well that home life means
Perceive you as a freak on show
Perceives herself as heroine 
Perform her soaring soulful flight
Perfumes in crystal jars arrayed
Perhaps I give occasion to
Perhaps a flattering hopes illusion
Perhaps along the Nevas shore
Perhaps an ancient glow of passion
Perhaps has carried off forever
Perhaps he also dimly knew
Perhaps if fate should prove unkind
Perhaps in his final years this poet of light could not fully adjust to the passing of his youth and the waning of youths poetic energy If he would not become a poet of the dark perhaps he did at the last become the seer of an unbearable lightness of being In several of his later poems some spectral beast of retribution seems to haunt the poets mind along with premonitions of and even yearnings for an early death But the ending in human life is always the same whereas in great art as in the plenitude of Pushkins work it can at least seem otherwise Pushkin retained to the last his humility before Providence and he went to his duel and his death completely in character We cannot finally answer the question who is Pushkin We can only say with some degree of certainty what he is Russias most utter artist its closest thing to the pure poet incarnate that being who sacrifices all the other possibilities of his human existence to the expression through language of lifes fascinating variety The aim of poetry Pushkin asserted is poetry itself the poet emerges from the creative spirit to show us the world and speak of things beyond our normal ken he is the voice of times fleeting and intricate fullness
Perhaps in thought we reassemble
Perhaps my friends by fates decree
Perhaps upon the worlds great stages
Perhaps when time had helped in quelling
Perhaps youd like you gentle fellow

Pushkin is something of an artistic chameleon and this is why it is so difficult to define him or to fix on a clear and consistent image of his authorial person and stance He seems almost to lack a coherent artistic persona like a chameleon he seems capable of changing his colours and of adapting to almost
Pushkins intricate and playful exploration of the connections between art and life permeates the work His own practice as a poet is a case in point issuing not only from his own genius but from his enormous reading and his extensive knowledge of literary tradition The novels verse poetry of the highest order is also at times a pastiche of all the many clichs of poetic imagery and diction of the techniques and formal conventions of a vast existing literature though the writer may violate or mix or parody these traditions he cannot exist without them In support of its authors sly yet revealing game the novel is full of literary allusions and references to other writers it mocks the easy conflation of literature and life in countless ways by the device for example of mixing real with fictional personages Most prominently of course Pushkin has inserted himself into his book not only as its narrator but as the ostensible friend of its hero Onegin Tatyana to give another instance encounters and captivates at a Moscow soire Prince Vyazemsky Pushkins actual friend and fellowpoet When the poem momentarily turns historical novel the Emperor Napoleon briefly appears only to be condemned as the impostor in Russian memory whose heroic pretensions were consumed by a Moscow conflagration and by lifes intractability Napoleon also figures in the novel as an icon of the European romantic imagination and ironically as the idol of the westernized Russian Onegin who keeps a statuette of his hero in his study
Pushkins long poem has had some seven English translations prior to this one the more thorough Germans seem to have produced about twelve and yet it has continued to be regarded

Quite ceased to tempt him any more
Quite charmed her heart when they were told
Quite curtly offered satisfaction
Quite other lines that rose unbidden
Quite pampered by a life of leisure
Quite possibly for years on end
Quite sure hell find Kavrin pacing
Quite unadorned her face gone white
Recall Moina    and rejoice
Recall the satirist good brother
Recall the words of passions heat
Recalling like some friend my song
Recasting platitudes till weary
Receive our races hymns of praise
Red bloody tongues and snouts and nails
Red wine by tumbler night and day 
Refreshed the stage with comic joy
Refused he found quick consolation
Regards those streams and smoky clouds
Regretted still his past delights
Released to them the whole estate   
Relief from labours for a time
Relying on a tyrants honour
Remain the same theyve not been altered
Remained beyond her comprehension
Remembers him his brides devotion
Reminds him that its dinner time
Remote one moment gay the next
Removed to where two oaklings stand
Renew themselves with joy and quicken
Repeating it a hundred ways
Repeats what mama taught to her
Repose in peace young poet here
Responding to our journals call
Restored to home and its safekeeping
Retainers crowd the gate pellmell
Retreats for happy assignations
Reverberates  the cabin quivers
Revive it with a jealous flame
Revive my hopes with but a sign 
Rewards you with a soft caress
Right then and there Vladimir penned
Ripe red currants let us throw
Romp away sweet lassies now 
Rosettes a torch a pair of hearts
Rouse Tanya from her bed to listen
Rousseau permit me this digression
Runs to the stricken youth    and stares
Russian novel and arguably the most influential in a number of crucial ways and provides the ground for its unique flavour and a strangeness that both delights and perplexes the reader The work is many things a stylistic tour de force an examination of human character and of the power in human affairs of cultural phenomena especially social and artistic conventions an investigation of the interconnections between literature and life an autobiography and an exploration of the creative process itself It is also of course and above all else incomparable poetry Highly structured in its use of an unvarying stanzaic form and in its classically balanced design the work nevertheless conveys an atmosphere of freeflowing spontaneity Its verse while observing elegantly the requirements of metre and rhyme is able at the same time to achieve the rhythm and feel of the most natural and ordinary colloquial speech Like a discursive prose work the novel exhibits a wealth of genial meandering talk and an apparently casual approach to narrative pace The plot itself is elegantly simple Treating of the frustrations of love it deals as Vladimir Nabokov puts it with the emotions meditations acts and destinies of three men Onegin the bored fop Lensky the minor elegiast and a stylized Pushkin Onegins friendand in a pleasing symmetry with the affections and fates of three heroines Tatyana the shy and bookish provincial maiden Olga her beautiful but ordinary younger sister and Pushkins mercurial Muse The action set in the imperial Russia of the s begins in a glittering St Petersburg moves for an extended stay to the bucolic country estate sojourns for a chapter in Moscow and then as if closing a circle comes to its end in the capital once more Along its devious narrative route the novel treats the reader to an engaging and suspenseful story to lively scenes of city and country life to portraits of a socially mixed cast of characters to evocations of nature in its various seasons and to

Shall I return And Tanya sighs
Shall instantly decide his lot
Shall once again I hear your chants
Share meals and pastimes thoughts and ends
Sharppeaked and ringed by hills it hovers   
Shaw J Pushkin A Concordance to the Poetry Columbus Oh 
She beat the maids when she was cross
She blossomed in a maidens ways
She blushes in appreciation
She bounded from the porch above
She brought her gifts    and danced about
She called from parlour couch to greet them
She cannot raise her eyes to face them
She cant go on she shuts her eyes
She cant make sense of what shes hearing
She casts no brazen glance around
She checked her funds and then decided
She dare not look to see behind her
She does not bid him rise or go
She does not say Lets wait till later
She doesnt greet the winters glow
She doesnt see or doesnt care
She entered the deserted gate
She falls 
She fell in love For thus indeed
She finds a brothers slayer hateful
She finds all former pleasures bleak
She finds in alphabetic order
She finds it all a priceless treasure
She flies and breaks through lilac bushes
She flits on tiptoe with a sigh
She found Onegins soul reflected
She found a cue left unattended
She found a great deal more appealing
She found a secret charm in part
She gave no hint of agitation
She gave the poet intimations
She hardly notes how late the hour
She heeds and doesnt heed the roses
She isnt hurried or obtrusive
She just undressed and went to bed
She kept the books she shaved the shirkers
She knew the Russian language badly
She knows youWe were neighbours Prince
She laced her corset very tightly
She lacked that fresh and rosy tone
She lacked the slightest predilection
She learned their ways and soon grew wild
She learned to use her womans powers
She left him then Eugene forsaken
She lets it lie she mustnt linger
She lies atop the farthest mountain
She lies there sleepless and uncertain
She lies within his arms inertly
She likes the stately disposition
She loved the fictions and the fancies
She loved to greet Auroras show
She made her weekly bathhouse call
She may be dreaming not of you
She murmured something through her pain
She never learned to show affection
She never touched a fragile finger
She pays him not the least attention
She pays no heed to guests at all
She pickled mushrooms for the fall
She races down the meadow course
She read my friends that king of sages
She roams in aimless desolation
She rode with me those craggy heights
She rose at dawn and off she started
She runs   but he keeps crashing on   
She runs she flies she dare not wait
She saw it all In desolation
She saw no friendly soul on station
She seemed the same shed always been
She seems the very illustration
She sees an unknown yard instead
She shuddered but she didnt speak
She sighs    and in her soul possessing
She sinks in snow the bear alertly
She sits before the windowsill
She softly sheds a flood of tears
She spied a distant hamlets glow
She spins away the wintry night
She stands beneath the crown a bride
She stepped inside the empty shell
She takes a garden path and sighs
She takes no note of dawns procession
She too now yawns and as she dances
She took a seat beside the chair
She took it and with languid bearing
She took it with a trembling hand
She trembles burns and waits  so near him
She tries to flee    but feels too weak
She turns all offers down completely
She used to write with blood quotations
She views the winter path ahead
She walked and walked   till with a shiver
She walks upon a snowy dale
She wanders with her borrowed lovers
She wants to scream    but cannot speak
She whispers in a soft refrain
She yields without conditions boldly
Shed be quite overcome with terror
Shed been condemned to feel desire
Shed drive around to check the workers
Shed hurry and in agitation
Shell never see him    and be grateful
Shell share with none aloud like this
Shell wonder too Did Olga languish
Shes in a hall no bear at least
Shes levelled with a fluffy blanket
Shes like that stupid moon you see
Shes mine announced Eugene commanding
Shes no coquette in any part
Shes out the backway down the stair
Shes pale and wasted doesnt speak
Shes reached the wood the bear still tracking
Shes spread herself through field and fountain
Shes stifled here    and in her mind
Shishkov Admiral Alexander Shishkov  the leader of the Archaic group of writers was a statesman and publicist who attacked both Gallicisms and liberal thought in Russian letters
Shoot pistol at an ace and hit
Should I go on turn back or what
Should each not part once more as brother   
Should they not laugh while yet theres time
Shrieks out in stupid shock thats me
Shy as a doe and apprehensive
Simmons E Pushkin New York 
Since I dropped sinning long ago
Since after all Im one of them
Since dawn Dame Larins near relations
Since then it seems theyve hardly mattered
Since young Tatyana with her lover
Sing God knows whom in splendid art
Sing our secret ditty now 
Sings out till dawn a crimson cover
Sit down   How strange  I cant begin   
Sits ananas in splendid gold
Sits gazing at the darkened plain
Sleep shuns her bed all sweetness goes
Slow Lethe then with grim insistence
Small hamlets too the eye could see
So Lensky soared as he awaited
So be it then Henceforth I place 
So books like women he deserted
So circumspect so strict in bearing
So dignified so awfully smart
So friskycarefree with her grin
So grant them God long life and ease
So harsh and negative a view
So he could quickly disappear
So he might lunch with them as guest
So he returned one day to fall
So hear me through without vexation
So heres his letter word for word
So inaccessibly serene
So judge yourself what wed be buying
So let him meanwhile live his life Believing in the worlds perfection
So marmotlike through winters night
So meanwhile friends enjoy your blessing
So much of life have I neglected
So peace to you you woes of yore
So pious and so chaste of heart
So pleased with all he had in life
So rend my soul so flame my blood
So round and fair of face is she
So she was called Tatyana reader
So short a time since I baptized you 
So stay beneath your roof try reading
So thank the Lord that in this nation
So there it isthe mobs opinion
So this is what it means to see the world
So thus he failed to join the faction
So unconcerned with him  so cold
So we in fancy then were borne
So whats ahead Ennui ennui  
So why do you pursue me now
So why is Tanya then more tainted
So wrapt in thought she hasnt heard
Soft snow kneedeep lies all about
Sole heir to all the kin he knew
Some are no more and distant   others
Some army scribbler will have written
Some bagatelle when youd been drinking
Some cards with me to pass the day
Some common madrigal to please
Some distant droshkys rumbling beat
Some even knowingly conceded
Some fables he could sell tomorrow
Some favourite authors fond creation
Some feeling for Tatyanas lot
Some fruit liqueurs and applejack
Some future dunce with warm effusion
Some general stared her way a lot
Some imprecision of the tongue
Some jars of jam and kitchen wares
Some lacked all conscience some all sense
Some memory of that park and lane
Some moments passed in utter quiet
Some moralistic novel say
Some mornings still abed he drowses
Some other and more ancient spring
Some others too might well have noted
Some pages still preserved the traces
Some pots and basins and the rest
Some raved or lied and some were dense
Some sacred truth a living word
Some serf girls in the orchard there
Some tea to whet their tittletattle
Some wondrous thing that she would learn
Some works and authors even so
Some would that ladies be required
Sometimes a shepherd sits there waiting
Soon Olgas happy voice and beauty
Soon proved a wearisome attraction
Speak ill of Moscow
Speak out on Tanyas situation
Spring calls you to your country seat
Spring rays at last begin to muster
Stand fizzing on the table yet

Stared out the window and squashed flies
Steel files and combs in many guises
Steps out of doors and trains a mirror
Stern censure in your former fashion
Still fidget freezing in the snow
Still glitter grandly all about
Still has her friend Monsieur Finemouch
Still held his youthful mind in thrall
Still hopeful and indeed persistent
Still longer half the globe encumbers
Still love    because theyre fated to
Still others sneered or turned malignant
Still pleasanter is mute insistence
Still powdered is Lukrya Lvvna
Still sleeps on furs at carriage door
Still sniffling coughing hissing clapping
Still stir my heart at times to flight
Stood by a river Far away
Stood seared as if by heavens fire
Straight out of life will crowd us too
Straight scissors curved ones thirty sizes
Strasbourg pie a rich pastry made with goose liver for which the French city is famous
Stretched out with death upon his brow
Strict judges not to be derided
Strike you up a rousing song 
Subduing passions host of troubles
Sublime emotions every feature
Sufficient for one winters stay
Surprised next morning when he found
Survives when even tempests spin
Svetlana the heroine of Zhukovskys ballad In the poem when Svetlana conjures her absent lover he carries her off to his grave Fortunately Svetlanas terrors remain only a dream
Sweet Lei now floats above her head
Sweet elegies whose full collection
Sweet idleness You have my heart
Sweet talk with friends on which Ive fed
Sweet thoughts of him in darkest night
Sweet wilderness in which I spent
Symposium on the th Anniversary of his Birth New York 
THE END
Take Tanya in and call her friend
Take walks The views give little reason
Takes in their ravishing deceits
Takes on a film of ash and pales
Takes up his pen    His verses ring
Takes up his stand in indecision

Tatyana    only her alone
Tatyana O my dear Tatyana
Tatyana and your Olga pray   
Tatyana as her nurse suggested
Tatyana blushed and trembled gently
Tatyana bowed her head in shame
Tatyana by the window lingers
Tatyana heard the news morosely
Tatyana heeded with conviction
Tatyana in her lowcut gown
Tatyana lies there nearly dead
Tatyana listened to him preach
Tatyana listened with vexation
Tatyana listens scarcely hearing
Tatyana looks in melting pleasure
Tatyana looks with eyes unseeing
Tatyana murmured at a loss
Tatyana never joined their play
Tatyana pictures her Eugene
Tatyana pined in isolation
Tatyana screamed He growled and reared
Tatyana seeks some passage showing
Tatyana seemed among her kin
Tatyana stopped in sudden dread
Tatyana thanks them for the day
Tatyana though stayed calm and steady
Tatyana to our heros side
Tatyana tosses through the night
Tatyana tries to pay attention
Tatyana turns to say goodbye
Tatyana waits will he reply
Tatyana walked alone and dreaming
Tatyana watches fascinated
Tatyana wept and mourned her lot  
Tatyana whispring in her ear
Tatyana with a Russian duty
Tatyana woke and idly glancing
Tatyanas Letter to Onegin
Tatyanas charms and pallid air
Tatyanas falling in love We are told that she does so as a child of nature spontaneously and without artificial contrivance that she falls in love in response to the neighbours gossip which has planted the idea in her mind that it is due to the influence of the epistolary novels she has read or that it was simply appropriate to her age and social expectations Having amused his readers with this shrewd undermining of typical romantic attitudes Pushkin then surprises them and complicates their perceptions of truth by giving a beautifully poetic description of Tatyana as a girl actually in love with all the restless pain joy and dreaminess of her condition The scene occurs furthermore in the wonderfully effective context of Tatyanas conversation with her concerned old nurse seen in touching and realistic counterpoint to the feverish young girl
Tatyanas favourite Now when sorrow
Tatyanas letter lies beside me

Than all her friends in heavens blue
Than bearing all his pain unheard
Than down the sloping shoreline bounding
Than he who brought the lady there
Than homes in which the wretched wife
Than our glum rhymesters of today  
That Cleopatra of the North
That Freedoms Champion went astray
That I turn father take a wife
That Id have been the first to cheer
That Paris of the local towns
That Tanyad finally found a man
That all of Russia scarcely numbers
That all our finest aspirations
That angel   and proud fiend as well
That any garret babbler hatches
That any zealous vulgar phrase
That as it is my diction groans
That bachelors lives were out of joint
That child of ventures and finances
That dangerous and sad pariah
That death had opened wide its portals
That dusky lindenshaded walk
That endless chant the waves unfurled
That even now she pined and waited
That everyone has heard his voice
That figure standing mute and frozen
That figure with the strange expression
That finding my ideal in you
That foggy book theyre all debating
That former wastrel and disaster
That friend of freedom ruled the scene
That friendly hands would surely rise
That group in front you see that pair   
That guests were soon to be expected
That habit takes the place of bliss
That he had wit and charm as well
That heavy general Tanya frowned
That hed found something else to do
That held her heart she knew not why
That high and mighty Moscow knows
That idle and reclusive schemer
That idol whom ripe misses cheer
That in their burning flow caress
That lady in the red beret
That lamp to which weve consecrated
That lie on maidens bedside tables
That like proud Byron I have penned
That little girl whose warm esteem
That long ago shed often heard
That made her sisters beauty sweeter
That marks his face  Is that Eugene 
That miracles could still be wrought
That momentary tender look
That no reward on earth compares
That no young girl thirteen
That our good friend was only kind
That our young pilgrim leave at last
That panting on a bench at last
That paying visits does me in
That poor enamoured girl hed known
That queen of secrets and of sighing
That question you have put before
That recluse from the world we know
That seared my Tanyas wounded heart
That sees in sounds lifes highest quest
That semilight so pale and solemn
That set Eugene and me apart
That sets the aching heart atremble
That shaggy footman at her heels   
That sometimes heavy but goodhearted
That sorceress the winters here
That sparkles triumphs and delights
That splendid view of distant domes
That stranger no one seems to know
That strikes him with such awful pleading
That there exists a holy cluster
That they would even grow impatient
That we betrayed it every hour
That wedding plans had long been set
That wicked gossip with his flair
That with a secret exultation
That work of heaven or of hell
That wraps about the Yuletide night
That your good friend wont find delightful
Thats fine of course but all Ive found
Thats five and twenty cantos long
Thats not romanticism surely

The Corsair or the Wandering Jew
The Flemish painters motley stuff
The German bakers up and baking
The Girls Song
The Harlikvs were feeling mellow
The Hindus herehis pearls to proffer
The Kras and Argvas banks
The Larin girlYou mean Tatyana
The Larin placeWhat reckless daring
The Latin vogue today is waning
The London social sets decry
The Lord be with you now my daughter
The Muse appeared as love was ending
The Muse first came to make me thrill
The Muse then made them living creatures
The Nereids eternal chorus
The North now howls the winds are driving
The Russian winter passing by
The Vampire with his pensive brow
The ache of love pursues Tatyana 
The actual things that make it thrive
The age of hopes and tender yearnings
The aged ladies decked in roses
The altar fire is out and done   
The ancient Kremlins hallowed keys
The ancient coach creeps out the gate
The ancient manse had been erected
The answer in his solemn leer
The arms compressed and folded flat
The aunts exchanged a wink and nodded
The awesome blaze my Moscow wrought
The awful word so lightly uttered
The badge on those two maidsinwaiting
The bailiff wrote as if on cue
The balalaikas now my pleasure
The balls go in each bevelled housing
The balmy fragrance of the night
The band of goblins putting out
The bane of midnight sentry stations
The bard of Juan and the Giaour
The bard whose modestys endearing
The bathhouse table laid for two
The beams from heavens lanterns flash
The bear just followed where she led
The bear proclaims My gossips in
The bearded postboy sits as spotter
The beauties in their filmy dresses
The bee flies out from waxen cell
The bill to awesome stature grows
The blood within this withered heart
The blow has left poor Lensky shattered
The boredom brother theres the harm
The bosom friend shed always cherished
The bottle pops as cork goes flying
The brand new ballets on in town
The breathless night is warm and soft
The breeder from the steppe as well
The brilliant madcap of confession
The burbling brook the wooded shade
The busy master never took
The cabby plods to hackney row
The call that brings them gathering round
The caravan of cackling geese
The cattle low and by the moon
The cavatina heated sighs
The cell in which hed hibernated
The chairs pushed back give out a clatter
The chance to know Onegin well
The charm of gravely simple things
The charming ladies twirl their feet
The charming line belle Tatyan
The charming sex is light as fluff
The chasms banks atop the ridge
The chill of life with passing time
The choice of books seemed strange indeed
The clever husband chose correctly
The clink of glasses shouts    confound her
The clink of plates and forks increases
The clock strikes ten and off hes racing
The clouds before them far and near
The coaches and the people struggle
The cock hails Vesper once again
The cold sharp mind that he possessed
The colonels sending it tonight
The comet wine comes gushing out
The company commanders here
The conversation sparkled bright
The cooks make lunch for one and all
The corset albums chic relations
The country love green fields and flowers
The country place where my Eugene
The countryside poor village neighbours
The course of youthful loves progression
The covenants of bygone races
The covered sleigh for years neglected
The crafty husband fawned and chuckled
The crowd moves on to drawing room
The crush the glitter and the gladness
The cry resounds Make way Lets go
The cues forgot the billiards fade
The cunning captive any day
The cunning of a base ambition
The curtain rustles as it soars
The daring satirist Fonvizin
The darkness wanes but Tanya still
The darling sister whom shed nourished
The dawn arises cold and cheerless
The day ahead all planned and taken
The day wore on no word came flying
The days flew by The winter season
The days grew short and as they sped
The desk the lamp that stands unlighted
The devil take you Uncle Die
The die is cast Im in your power 
The distant vault of heavens hood
The doors fly back two figures enter
The double carriage lamps in rows
The doubts that plagued his heart and will
The drawing room explodes with noise
The drawing room had rich brocades
The dread of vice the fear of shame
The dreadful harm of what hed done
The driver sits behind the dash
The droning music never ceases
The duellists shed their cloaks and wait
The earlynineteenthcentury critic Belinsky remarked famously that Pushkins novel is an encyclopedia of Russian life Although it is currently fashionable to disparage Belinskys crudely sociological approach to literature there is much to be said especially if we remove the word Russian for his observation For all this works literary selfconsciousness it is an encyclopedia of literature too what a richly woven and glittering tapestry of life it contains much of it supplied in apparently casual passing fashion as was Pushkins way He shows us the theatre where on a public stage writers actors and audience all perform and where the wings become a setting for erotic adventure he gives us dance in its many shapes and styles the ballet the society ball the country shindig the peasant stomp other music and song in opera in a regimental band in the singing of serfgirls food and dining in fashionable restaurants and at rustic feasts the architectural environment in churches palaces city mansions apartments urban hovels and country manors the varying styles of clothing the books the protocols of duelling the customs of matchmaking courtship and marriage life as played out in passionate youth and in resigned middleage the relationships of parents and children the ways of the contemporary city and the ancient traditions of the countryside the horses and conveyances that people use which are also metaphors for the Pushkinian rush to experience lifes variety or at least to observe it from the window of a moving carriageall the activities codes customs and conventions through which we live and which

The effect of lightness the exceptional clarity that so famously accompanies Pushkins breadth of interests goes hand in hand with his vaunted terseness and simplicity his evident and easy accessibility But his terseness can be more apparent than real for his art has the capacity to suggest much in a few spare and simple observations and his simplicity can be deceptive screening from the casual reader an art of great sophistication and delicacy To the foreign reader especially Pushkins qualities of clarity and simplicity can be an impediment to the appreciation of his work and if the reader has first come to Russian literature through the tormented and profound explorations of
The emptiness that plagues his soul
The empty fields in silence wait
The endless dance had come to seem
The endless round the varied game
The evening samovar grew hot
The ever dauntless hero stood
The faces one encounters daily
The fall that year was in no hurry
The falsehoods in reviews the war
The fame of Lovelaces has faded
The familys well I think Id say
The fate that Tula clerk was dealt
The fateful news hed been betrayed
The featherbeds and coops of chickens
The feet of ladies known before
The fields all lay in misty peace
The fields are dark now what a shame
The fields are silver where they froze  
The final hours come at last
The fine and noble aspiration
The fire goes out the coal still gleaming
The fire in both our hearts was pale
The first four steps that lay ahead
The first sharp hammer clicks resound
The first within me light no fires
The fizzing wine comes gushing fast
The flame within him would have died
The fleeting works of my creation
The flirt will always reason coldly
The foes How long has bloodlust parted
The foes stood by with eyes downcast
The fools one never once forgets
The foot of sweet Terpsichore
The forewords here if overdue
The friendly sun less often sparkled
The frightful vision must foretell
The frigid yawning days to be
The frost already cracks and crunches
The frost has gleamed and we give thanks
The frozen corpse on sleigh preparing
The frozen windows sparkling bright
The fruits that learned science brought
The furnishings were plain but stable
The gamblers here with dice all loaded
The game of billiards all day through
The gaping wound beneath his breast
The garden lane when straight ahead
The general with the prideful air
The ghost of days beyond recall
The giddiness of passions sway
The girl whose letter he still kept
The girlish hopes on which I fed
The girls all jump and grow excited
The girls attentive eye embraces
The girls near Tanya men delighted
The glasses jingle and resound
The gleaming pistols wake from drowsing
The glory of our days of old
The glow of life has vanished starkly
The goal of life he found was still
The god that makes this world go round
The golden autumn now arriving
The good old lady was delighted
The gowns the talk the milling mass
The graves eternal fateful mystery
The great Casinos opened up
The great Rossini there to harken
The great finales thunder surges
The greatest hall when it resounded
The greedy horde demanding pay
The grove the hill the field the thicket
The groves asleep above the river
The grunting loathesome bear still lumbers
The guardsman clinks his spurs and dances
The guests all bow and scrape their feet
The guests all squeeze toward the centre
The guests all stare in mute surprise
The guests all treated so sincerely
The hall is full of crowds and bustle
The happiness for which I live
The haughty world would watch her closely
The heap of books the carpet spread
The heapedup wagons now are readied
The heart no cause to beat the quicker
The hearth the double panes shut tight
The hearts dark secrets and traditions
The hearts of even skilled coquettes
The hearts reflections writ in tears
The heated words grow louder quicken
The heavens chose my destination 
The heavens sparkle now with blue
The heavy silence grew protracted
The hero in his work of fiction
The hero of my current tale
The hero of our novels action
The heros named the plottings done
The holy days are here What gladness  
The horses neighed their nostrils flaring
The host of girls on marriage hunts
The hostess artfully arranges
The hostess cries At last youre here
The hostess kept the banter light
The hostess sees a lady coming
The hours of waking and of night
The household keys she always kept
The hubbub grows more animated   
The humble sinner Dmitry Larin
The hunter hiding in the trees
The iceclad rivers glassy lustre
The intellects cold observations
The iron bust upon its column
The jagged flints are set to go
The jealous poets mood turned festive
The jesting praise the pleading eyes  
The joy and hope of district mothers
The joyous tribe of boys berates
The kind of thought or observation
The ladies flocked to stand beside her
The ladies gowns so well designed
The ladies to the hearth repair
The lakeway path the wood and on
The landed gentwith daughters ripe
The language of the gods she shed
The languid mind will find no spark
The last eighth chapter of Eugene Onegin was published separately with the following foreword
The latter hard upon first greeting
The less we love her when we woo her
The letter she would send caressing
The letter trembles in her fingers
The letters readyall but sent  
The little girl with docile doll
The lofty Muses of his art
The loge where beautiful and gleaming
The longawaited sail he sought
The lover of Julie Wolmr
The loves and intrigues of the past
The maid alone was left there standing
The maidens whisper by the stair
The maids have gathered one and all
The mail has kept him evidently
The manner grand can only bore
The manor house in proud seclusion
The mans a boor hes off his rocker
The marker half asleep emerges
The marriage maker kept on calling
The masses of your mountains gleamed
The mattresses the trunks and chairs
The men bowed lower when they spied her
The merchant to the port advances
The merchants up the pedlar scurries
The merchants youthful wife sits dreaming
The mix of years and ranks she sees
The modern Russians new disease
The modish beautys modish foe
The molten wax submerge and turn
The moment one of them was sighted
The monde abhors a fickle heart
The monde the noisy ball forgot
The moody fellow still unchastened
The moonlight shines upon her sill
The more we draw a woman in
The morning star will gleam tomorrow
The musics roar the ballroom trembling
The mysteries of its ancient past
The mysteries of the marriage bed
The mystery that those pages told
The nameday feast thats just begun
The narrator constantly intrudes on his story postponing with his various digressions its progress speculating on where it might lead and frequently frustrating his readers expectations By exposing the works contrived literariness the narrator continually threatens to subvert or deconstruct the novelistic truth of his tale But then again on resuming his narrative he will recapture our interest in his heroes fates and reignite an acceptance of their reality In his frequent address to both readers and friends the latter comprised apparently of more sophisticated sorts of reader the author anticipates almost all the potential ways of approaching and interpreting his book and seems to be trying to fashion out of an amalgam
The neighbours shake their heads morosely
The next dance too In Gods creation
The night before and what took place
The night grew still   with silence falling
The night has countless stars to light her
The nightingale in darkest wood
The nightingale pours forth its tune
The nighttime lanterns all about
The nobly born and fashions pets
The note was brief in its correctness
The old Derzhvin sawand blessed us
The old corve and substituted
The old mazurka hasnt faltered
The old was dated through and through
The omission of certain stanzas has given rise on more than one occasion to criticism and jesting no doubt most just and witty The author candidly confesses that he has removed from his novel an entire chapter in which Onegins journey across Russia was described It behoved him to indicate this omitted chapter by dots or a numeral but to avoid ambiguity he thought it preferable to label as number eight instead of nine the final chapter of Eugene Onegin and to sacrifice one of its closing stanzas
The one she feared the one she prized
The one to whom when face to face
The one we sing to will be rich
The onetime corsair Morali
The only clever thing hes done
The other   But well talk tomorrow
The other day in rainy weather
The other translators who have put Pushkins novel into English have chosen unlike Nabokov to honour in most respects the Onegin stanza and to retain the originals metrical scheme and rhyme Two of them in particular Walter Arndt and Charles Johnston have done so with some success and have demonstrated thereby that the task may be slightly less impossible than it seems My own attempt to pursue the elusive Pushkin yet again has profited much by their example following them in their virtues and avoiding as far as possible their defects If the results presented here are no less provisional than their efforts or the efforts of others that have gone before I have none the less greatly enjoyed my pursuit of Pushkin and have found the view even from the lower altitudes well worth the climb
The pages of some dull review
The panes chalked white The owners fled
The peasant dances drunken roar
The peasants there have hoards of treasure
The people yawning in for prayer
The pines in all their beauty frown
The pistol in his hand like lead
The place Eugene found so confining
The plain inscription skimming lightly
The playful tune that keeps on drumming
The poet feasting on confession
The poet for Pushkin is a mysterious being inspired to
The poet lost in hot contention
The poets gone    and hardly one
The poets note about a meeting
The portly Mr Pustyakv
The pranks and fun when first theyd met
The prejudice that haunts all history
The press intense the hubbub loud
The priests and guests left one by one
The prima donna The ballet
The princess an impassioned letter
The princess looked at himserene
The princess sits alone in sight
The princess to his added tension
The principles of Russian rhyme
The printed verse had lain neglected
The quickly summoned glistening tear
The rascal froze his fingers playing
The regimental bands appearing
The restless gallery claps and roars
The restless hero waiting there
The rising vapours faintly streaming
The river gay and sparkling bright
The roofs the yard the fenceall white
The room where fashions model pupil
The rooms of Olga and Tatyana
The rosy sealing wafer lingers
The rousing waltz goes whirling round
The rutted snow had turned to slush
The sacred dreams that fill your gaze
The sacred ecstasy of art
The salvaged streets will muster shoulders
The same old patterns still are met
The scarcely risen newborn day
The sceptic Bayle he quite devoured
The second night the snow fell late
The secret refuge of the tomb   
The sense and taste of ages past
The sentimental verses too
The servant maids would guess the fate
The servants fussed and raised the dickens
The shapes of ladies heads and feet
The sheep of Kalmuk herdsmen stand
The shepherds pipe resounds and urges
The shrubs the land  all lie asleep
The shutters open smoke ascends
The sick old ladys kindly smile
The simple girl hed known before
The sky all lightly veiled and streaming
The sky breathed autumn turned and darkled
The sleigh glides over ruts and passes
The sleighs and rosy snow that shimmers
The sleighs prepared his pacing ceases
The slightest hope that on occasion
The slow parade of guests who pass
The snow his wife and much much more
The social buzz became a bore
The social cream had gathered gaily
The social ritual never changes
The solemn experts learned air
The sombre men who form a frame
The sombre season near at hand
The song they sang was from the past
The sorry sight the fellow made
The soul with endless youthful kisses
The spleen is what the English call it
The spring with which our honours wound
The squires face each other wheezing
The stalls and pit are all ajitter
The stanza fashioned by my lyre
The steaming blood poured forth revealing
The still transparent woods renew
The stomach serves as clock for us
The storm has blown the lovely flower
The stout Moldavian prancing proudly
The strangeness of his interference
The stylish rings the couple needed
The sudden gust of wind surprises
The sum of all our heros parts
The swarming gallery throng that presses
The tale that my Onegin knew 
The tavern tribune and a liar
The theatres full the boxes glitter
The thing hed learned above all arts
The things a simple girl would say
The thirst for knowledge work and fame
The time goes by and as it goes
The time of day by teas and dinners
The time to quit the feast and fly
The time will come without a doubt
The torment of a heart in flames
The travellers futile appetite
The trees in winter silver dyed
The trembling dreams the heart can hold
The two Skotinins grey as sages
The two found everything a basis
The two friends greetings pass unheard
The two old ladies hugged and cried
The uncut story of your fate
The usual threecart train will carry
The vales grow dry and colours quicken
The very flower of French cuisine
The very object of your song
The very springtime of his days
The very windows shook like Hades
The vibrant voices sits apart
The view outdoorsthe lunar pall
The villager to rise Its morn
The vision too of maiden free
The voice of lover foe and friend
The way lies open war has passed
The way the watchful servants stare
The way they did in former ages
The way to master rampant grief
The ways in which a state progresses
The wayward fits the final surges
The wenches and the drivers brawl
The whirling flash of pairs of feet
The wilful swarm of hot desires
The will of God I guess  My Danny
The window boards have been inserted
The winter road is smooth as ice
The wives their jealous gossip spin
The wolf appears with hungry mate
The wood with mournful murmur shed
The works of Fontenelle he scoured
The world all fresh and white below
The world for just a time forgot
The world itself with magic power
The world she loves and says goodbye
The world with good or earn at least
The worlds fresh glitter and its call
The wretched girl is scarcely breathing
The years chase playful rhyme behind me
The years to solemn prose incline me
The young mans blissful brief infection
The young pursued my Muse like devils
The youngbloods yarns of courting death
The youthful lover of the dance
The youthful lover with his yen
The youthful lovers voice is stilled
The youthful poets friend and slayer
Their albums too you must have seen
Their charming words and glances sweet
Their chilly pride in high position
Their daughters after brief embraces
Their daughters with this semiRussian
Their downy green and start to thicken
Their elbows propped upon the table
Their fathers who were friends had plans
Their festive dinner all too pleasing
Their freedom for his honours splendour
Their girlish secrets of the heart
Their hopes and pranks and maiden dreams
Their jealous torments separation
Their joy is striking men with fear
Their laughing shouts and giddy joys
Their natural virtues flaunted banner
Their natures distant and apart
Their pitchers in the stream and dally
Their quartos to be signed by me
Their rings are drawn in random order
Their sex alas is hard to sway
Their talks absurd if harmless cant
Their tears of reconciliation
Their tendency to just drop in
Their vigil and embracing wept
Their youthful ravings and their blaze
Then Olga enters in confusion
Then Olga pushes through the door
Then Olgas suitor came awooing
Then afterwards as was his wont
Then all the crowd comes pouring in
Then asks her for the dance hes due
Then beds are made the guests are all
Then bowing to innate compassion
Then bring in her guitar excited   
Then broke into a coughing fit
Then called his men and walked away
Then crossed the girl and mumbled verse
Then crowds its forebears toward the grave
Then draws her to a corner gently
Then eighteen nags were led outside
Then feel her foot within my hand
Then follows her about all day
Then for a moment chatter ceases
Then from a basin filled with water
Then gave her spouse a look so tired
Then gave it up and finally ended
Then gives her hand a gentle squeeze
Then has the horses on command
Then howd you come to marry nanny
Then in his babbling neighbour races
Then knowthat were it in my power
Then lead them to the duelling site
Then leads each man to where hell stand
Then leaning by the door prepared
Then led the lady safe away
Then others too must heed the call
Then pushes straightway through the door
Then puts his couplet in her hands
Then rage or drink    Somehow proceeding
Then read and readfrustration growing
Then runs his fingers through his hair
Then sadly saw the lovers go
Then sang me to the churchyard gate
Then send your grandson little Thomas
Then spins and twists and stops to beat
Then spins her round before the guests
Then stalk love fasterand entreat
Then stir my blood and fill my breast
Then stretched a paw    sharp claws abhorrent
Then sudden hoofbeats    Now shes quaking   
Then supper came then time for bed
Then surely none but you alone
Then swift as arrows raced for home
Then this was certain sign to her
Then through his dressing room hell pass
Then tossed about and seemed demented
Then trading bows on every side
Then turned to see the books hed favoured
Then wined and dined and heavyhearted
Then yawned and turned his head away
Theocritus and Homer bored him
There Ozerov received the nations
There are considerably more than  lines of verse in this work and the sheer quantity of its rhyme it must be admitted sorely tests the translators inventiveness I am also well aware that rhyme today is somewhat less common in serious English verse than it used to be and that its pervasiveness here may seem uncongenial to the modern ear I rely therefore on the readers tolerance for traditions beyond the borders of current taste and on the hope that something archaic may have grown so unfamiliar as to offer perhaps the pleasure of novelty On some of the Russian names in the text and on a few other words I have placed an accent mark on the syllable that bears the stress in general however the iambic metre should be a sufficient guide to the pronunciation of unfamiliar words The Russian text used for this translation is essentially that used by Nabokov the socalled third edition the last to be published during Pushkins lifetime
There gleam the city gates already
There is no path the gorge that plummets
There lies a spot the poet cherished
There too a tombstone can be found
There too beneath the theatres tent
There too within a shaded nook
There was a time when I was keen
There was a time when breezes playing
Therell be a ball What sheer delight
Therell be a ball a childrens party
Therell be a crush and lots of babble
Theres bear and blizzard bridge and crow
Theres no absurdity or worse
Theres no one else whom Id adore 
Theres no one here to whom Ive spoken 
Theres not a calumny too vile
Theres nothing offers consolation
Theres wrath alone upon that face   
These clothes and faces with displeasure
These creatures then would lure him back
These days allotted me by fate   
These lines more quickly than the rest
These stupid woods and fields and streams
These words are hardly Russian stock
They all began to gossip slyly
They asked him round and sought to match
They dropped him cold and ceased to call
They find her stranger than expected
They flap their wings and fly from shore
They fluff her curls in latest fashion
They glower coldly as they scheme
They hang pretentious menu pages
They haunt my soul with dreams of strife
They held all ancient customs dear
They knew theyd settled that for good
They laid to rest the dear departed
They laughed Then guests began arriving
They made the barking hounds obey
They needed kvas no less than air
They passed the gardens dark recesses
They reach the mill He bids Guillot
They rode for seven days and nights
They say you like to be alone 
They seem so pallid and so weary
They seem to go before theyre here
They send you greetings and affection   
They sit Eugene can only stare
They sit in Olgas room together
They spade up silver from a ditch
They squeeze her hand and in the end
They steal away whenever able
They still assail a soul grown cold
They stir our hearts and fan the flame
They take her to the Grand Assembly
They took offence and one and all
They whisper Dunya dont look bored
Theyd meet on horse each afternoon
Theyd shed a tender tear or two
Theyll welcome us with great delight
Theyre all aboard and slowly gliding
Theyre closer    coming here    its he
Theyre hardly worth the songs one sings
Theyre harnessed to the coach and steadied
Theyre leaving for the duelling place
Theyre people whom were bound to prize
Theyve passed away or changed unbidden 
Theyve shifted round and been reseated
Theyve vacancies galore    take heart
This Grandison was fashions pet
This brief assessment of Pushkins place in Russian literature although it provides a reasonably accurate recital of established critical views ignores certain anomalies and paradoxes that are part of the Pushkin story Rather curiously for example all the prolific and prodigious achievement of this father of Russian literature was the work of a man whose chief public mask in his own day was that of a gadfly and wastrel Disciplined in his art he was often irresponsible and profligate in his social behaviour There was about him as the reminiscences of contemporaries observe something of the eternal schoolboy and prankster a bit of the renegade always at odds with the respectable adult world For several years he played the roles of dandy or bohemian he loved to shock with outlandish dress or
This careless gift for waxing tender
This child of comfort and of glamour
This distant goddess so transcendent
This dreadful ailments heavy toll
This fickel swain of every star
This fragile life that hurries so
This generations younger beauties
This heart still throbbed with inspiration
This hollow world has learned to shun
This homage that the great world tenders
This might well seem an indiscretion
This most unpleasant ttette
This night will pass the next one too
This noble and profound creation
This notes to himNow dont get riled
This placid lady he detected
This raving discourse of the heart
This swirling swamp in which we lie
This tattered life of masquerading
This tiring trek through town extended
This touching whimsy free of art
This was a poet yes indeed
This weary tinselled life of mine
This world of glitter fumes and noise
Those desert wastes and waves inspired
Those dreams and harmonies I tend
Those figures fancy has created
Those heady walks for which youre thirsting
Those journals where each modern Moses
Those joyous hopes that bloomed so brightly
Those kin whove come from distant places
Those massive cliffs and pounding sea
Those mighty years still rich in fame  
Those objects of your verse    and more
Those rushing tides in tumult tumbling
Those springtime days in secret valleys
Those twelfthtide eves by old tradition
Those who seek labels have made numerous attempts to define and categorize this astonishing writer He has been called variously a romantic and a realist the poet of freedom and the bard of Russias imperium he has been dubbed in political terms a radical a liberal and a conservative a revolutionary critic of the Czarist regime and its loyal defender Persuasive arguments can and have been made in support of each of these characterizations but a poet of genius always in the end evades our efforts to tame and contain him
Those words with whichbefore the feet
Thou bard of Finlands maid divine
Though here and there much labour lately
Though hes unknown and lives obscurely
Though not without a heartfelt sigh
Though now and then some gossip gleams
Though on the whole he saw no sense
Though pleased with the revenge hed taken
Though why they do I hardly know
Three bottles daily from Vrys
Three pairs of shapely feet  And yet
Through Albions great and haughty lyre
Through all her years since cradle days
Through drawing rooms hed pass and stare
Through empty hall then passes gliding
Through force of passion and of sense
Through grand salon And on  All bare
Through greening fields and watch it dally
Through marble entry rushes straightway
Through ranks of men from highborn classes
Through silent woods and so discovers
Through which he entered newly crowned
Throughout our native Russian ground
Throughout that barren dim dominion
Throughout the house the ceilings towered
Thus bees from luscious hive will scatter
Thus does our age its sins redress
Thus heaven wills the world to turn
Thus heavens gift to us is this
Thus peopleso it seems to me
Thus slowly down a sloping rise
Thus spake Eugene his admonition
Thus storms in autumn blowing colder
Thus stormy shadows cloak with grey
Till father blessed me and gave in
Till on the fields spring rains have passed
Time was when cold debauch was lauded
Time was when flunkies in high places
Time was with grave and measured diction

To join his forebears any day
To join the crowd where each is ready

To judge the wit with which I lie

To keep his wicked tongue in check
To keep sly mouths from feeling free
To keep your daughters well in sight
To laugh a bit at something new
To learn the news has heaven brought
To leave the city with its flurry

To rule the house as autocrat
To say that he was quite prepared 
To see how he may wane or flourish

To show their gall   and waistcoats too
To show them in their isolation

To social scandals kind of fame
To some soire    and by the door

To speak in singsong intonations
To spread their grudging shade a bit
To spy on Tanya down below
To stay with us and seemed transported
To stroll about at total leisure
To strut their stuff and thunder by
To swim upon the waters breast
To swoon and pass away    what rapture

To take his grieving bride directly
To take my rest from yesterday
To take some tea while Dunya poured
To take this note of mine to 
To talk once more and say goodbye
To talk to them of clothes or fashion
To tell you all in full detail
To tell you how this meeting went
To tend a sick man night and day
To tender novels she retreats
To the circle of our dance
To thirst with love in every part
To this offensive show of passion
To those with lavish whims and coffers
To thread a needle wouldnt linger
To touch a torrid hand to hers
To trumpet mask and dagger too
To turn at last to lifeless stone
To visit come the Christmas feast
To wander by the lonely lake
To wash those sizzling cutlets down
To waste itself in empty schemes
To watch the brilliant ballroom spin
To where the leafy woodlands rustle
To where the prostrate princess lay
To which Eugene paid special heed
To which he yielded one by one
To whisper hope and sweet delight
To whom How longSome two years since   
To whom amid the jealous throng
To whom will all our faults be few
To wondrous shapes which designated
To you Im sure was trite and old
To your repeated desperate cry
Tolstoy or Dostoevsky Pushkins view of the passing scene filled with a bracing humour as well as grief may produce a rather strange impression he is not at all what such a reader has come to expect of a Russian writer Unlike those two later masters Pushkin is neither philosopher nor religious thinker neither didactic moralist nor analytical psychologist He is both more universal in his sympathies and more modest in his artistic person
Tomorrow too will be the same
Too deaf and still to make reply
Too late he thought the moments wasted   
Tormented now by deep regret

Translated from the Russian with a Commentary  vols New York
Treats Europes dainty artefacts
Triquet stands up the congregation
True Gaul Triquet in pocket carried
True lovers of a funeral feast

Tumultuous fond recollections
Turn meadows into marshy ground
Turned south and all around there hovered
Turns curious to see still more
Twas dusk and on the table gleaming
Twas evening and the heavens darkled
Twas only habit then that taught her
Twas this our hero had contracted
Twice yearly too they did their fasting
Two Petriads a grammar book
Two Petriads heroic poems on Peter the Great several of which were in circulation at the time
Two hearts perhaps remain forlorn
Two maidens used to come with flowers
Two minutes barely has she sat  
Two pine trees grow there roots entwined
Two slender icebound poles lie linking
Two soldier husbands and a war
Two special feet And in my slumbers
Twould make an epigram of style 
T
Unbidden guests for their intrusion
Unbidden tears and its ovations
Unchanged when even years have passed
Undressed by candle he selected
Unfaithful women he had known
Unfit for maidens heart or head
Unlike those merchants filled with cares
Unluckily Dame Larin wasted
Unmetred lines of hallowed usage
Unmindful too of town or friends
Unmoved to count beneath the sun
Unsealed your heart to me so clearly
Unseen by bee or butterfly
Unsmiling faces on display
Until Brguets unsleeping chime
Until Triquet who had a knack
Until at last her fate was granted
Until at last her strength is gone
Until at last she whispered low 
Until at last the husband found
Until he had no means for more
Until his valet brings his tray
Unwillingly within the mirror
Up chimney flue The sparkling glasses
Up in that stupid sky you honour
Upon a bough above that urn
Upon a deuce that cunning bait
Upon her balcony appearing
Upon her fevered tongue and dries
Upon his neighbours place of sleeping
Upon my trail three years belated
Upon our mournful northern snow
Upon the ballrooms mirrored floor
Upon the crossroads of the sea
Upon the first page youll discover
Upon the lady whose expression
Upon the letter that she wrote
Upon the modish word ideal
Upon the moon to bring it nearer
Upon the porch with broom in hand
Upon the square the crowd emerges
Upon the stage still romp and roar
Upon the table after play
Upon their buttercups of rue
Upon those feet these lips    caressing
Use flattery as warm incentive
Vague threats and rumours premonitions
Vexation Pride Or youths old yen
Vivacious brilliant   and too light
Vladimir Lensky lies below
Vladimir Lnsky just returning
Vladimir gave a curt reply
Vladimir gave his heart and waited
Vladimir gently dozed for real
Vladimir hasnt heart to mention
Vladimir vowed he wouldnt run
Vladimir waited near the dam
Vladimirs stormy soul grew wings
Vrys Caf Very a Parisian restaurant
Vyzemsky Prince Pyotr Vyazemsky  friend of Pushkin
Warmed by the god of inspiration
Was I like that when I was tender
Was I so racked with yearnings anguish
Was all that Olga smiling said
Was at the time in full devoted
Was born beside the Nevas span
Was born to play this very part
Was carping at the millstones cam
Was given us in vain to burn
Was in his primea handsome youth
Was it not you who seemed to hover
Was like a blow Onegin shuddered
Was love itself the art of ardour
Was quite a lovely country nest
Was quite the pedant in his dress
Was sleeping soundly even then
Was this that girl or did he dream
Was this the Tanya he once scolded
Was wondrous tender If asserting
Was younger still than me my dear
We all take on Napoleons features
We call it simply Russian soul 
We drank in silent contemplation
We heed the rustling woods resurgence
We lack I know a worldly tone 
We may note in order to illustrate one of Pushkins methods for revealing the power of cultural determinants in his characters behaviour the various explanations the narrator gives for
We say romanticallyalthough
We sometimes like to listen then
We still alas cannot forestall it
Wed never heard of love you see
Well I despise your upper classes
Well I wont keep you have no worry
Well almost all that they possessed
Well dig bold tunnels neath the deep
Well heres my view of close relations
Well not have Tanya conjure so
Well shes just promised his good friend
Well show your Tanya
Well tell me what would you    inside
Well then come on    well go and meet her
Well this was my Eugenes conclusion
Well thus am I And was it merely
Well what about it Lord its ages  
Well wheres the harm  the evening passes
Well whip his heart and when its tame   
Welloff   and handsome in addition
Were bound for home Still waters sparkled
Were fond of songs for fortunecasting
Were just as dull as city highways
Were marked at home on their estate
Were my Onegins saintly pleasures
Were now no longer fit to write
Were objects of his thought no more
Were put to sleep by talk of sin
Were quite forgot she bid adieu
Were sure to bring a mocking gaze
Were these the thoughts that crossed my mind
Were you in love then long ago
Were your good friend before you now
Wet nurses shout and babies bleat
Weve all received an education
Weve got to have forbidden fruit
Weve roamed the world down one slim lane
What Invitations Yes three houses
What a sorrow
What ails you TanyaLifes so trifling
What aims    what hopes do 
What answer came Just stern rejection
What can I do Tatyanas grown
What casual letters he would send her
What clever traps hed set before him
What clues the index can afford her
What din debates The good Automne
What dreams of hers were reenacted
What evening holds or where hell go
What fate will morning bring my lyre
What fiery art his speech revealed
What from his prime had been his pleasure
What hitter scorn and condemnation 
What household goods are necessary
What is itmartyred pride or spleen
What languor fills her lovely breast
What languor when his lips were sealed
What mad and magic yearnings tore me
What more can I in candour say 
What more my friends could you demand
What news of oysters Here What rapture
What occupied the livelong day
What odes indeed he might have written
What passions in my soul awoke
What prosy ravings strung together
What role does he intend to fill
What roses Hymen means to send
What secret message shed been sent
What sombre echoes of ambition
What tender and oppressive yearning
What vernal flowers do you tread
What wars and famines have occurred
What was he then An imitation
What wicked and deserved derision 
What wings our first successes gave
What wintry frost surrounds her now
Whatever Paris seeking treasure
Whatever clever London offers
Whatever comes to his attention
Whatever feelings then lay hidden
Whatever reader your reaction
Whats given to us ever palls
Whats made that frigid soul excited
Whats more poor guiltless Lensky perished
Whats more that duelling fox has tasted
Whats more the husbands frank opinion
Whats stirring in that idle gaze
Whats that Just that Mere conversation
Whats that the crunching snow    whos coming
Whats this he hears Could she intend   
Whats wrong She peered at him intent
Whats wrong with him    Hes in a daze
When I recall how you reacted
When Tanyas ring turned up at last
When all agree and have long since
When all at once faroff Ive sighted
When basic products it possesses
When by the hearth hed sit alone
When captured by some boy in spring
When cherished beings filled my dreams
When dancing stars are disappearing
When earths horizon softly blushes
When filled once more with inspiration
When first I met you and detected
When he drives home she still engages
When he in flaming verse portrays
When headlong and alone on horse
When hed arrived and if of late
When in a frenzied state indeed
When in some quiet rural place
When in that silent room appeared
When in the parlour guests converse
When it has yet to fully flower
When just the masters least suggestion   
When men of reason and good humour
When mid the guests she recognized
When midnight sky is limpidlight
When neath your endless chant I pined
When off beside my lake I climb
When one becomes the butt of rumour
When one fine day our grandsons true
When one gets old life turns oppressive
When only bareness greets the eye
When our old roads decayed condition
When passions flame no longer rages
When scarce a boy and not yet knowing
When selfexpression gripped his friend
When she was small she didnt choose
When some good neighbour drops in weary
When some new demon seizes me
When suddenly far off it sees
When suddenly from ballroom doorway
When wayward fate has made me stray
When we at last turn into sages
When we have broadened education
When we lure the fellow on 
When we play our maiden games
When we see him from afar 
When we sing our secret songs
When you came in I seemed to waken 
When you with so much strength of mind
Whenever dazzling ladies proffer
Whenever nanny brought together
Where Im so much abused today
Where Lensky with his pawn once took
Where all breathes Europe to the senses
Where all was shown  all unprotected
Where are you Come I bow to you
Where commerce bustling crowds and presses
Where dawns vermilion rays are playing
Where every day before his eyes
Where fate once willed our confrontation
Where fingernails had sharply pressed
Where first I loved where first I wept
Where first Onegin I saw you
Where first our novels plot unfolded
Where girlfriends scribble hopes and blisses
Where he and Tanya had their talk
Where he and she once had their talk
Where hills half circle round a valley
Where is it better then
Where is your equal to be found
Where just Terpsichore enchants
Where lowly nature is enacted
Where master used to sit alone
Where maybe reader you began
Where no one raised the slightest fuss
Where now the ardent agitation
Where once our hero used to dwell
Where one who favoured soft reclining
Where only his sad trace remains
Where over my poor nanny now
Where she sits waiting    waiting still
Where skies for endless days are clear
Where swans call out and beauty dallies
Where sweet Thalia calmly dozes
Where two expectant merchants stand
Where two old friends in conversation
Where we are not
Where will he dash to my good hearty
Where will he make the nights first call
Where you spent wintertime in play
Whereas the ode has aims sublime
Which Lensky blushing leaves unread   
Which Ovid sang in ages past
Which is to say that he could tell
Which justdelivered importations
Which made poor Olga feel bereft
Which meant a longer trip of course
Which might in turn bring you some claim
Which seems a touch absurd today
Which we of course in him should praise
Which wines have come without delay
Which young Semynova did share
While Fate intends no grand conclusion   
While I mid friends was drunk with pride
While I perhaps descend in sorrow
While I roar out the light refrains
While Iso long ago it seems
While Lensky rages at the sight
While Morpheus still roamed in flight
While Petersburg already rousing
While all those cupids devils serpents
While everywhere before your eyes
While far away some rousing song
While he plays horse and runs ahead
While high above the moons aloft
While in his mind Imagination
While in the back her husband dozes
While in the yard their men reproach
While life was still but in its morn
While muffled by the violin
While near at hand all dense and shaded
While neath her downy pillow lying
While never meaning to be spiteful
While next to Limburgs lively mould
While none held head and shoulders higher
While nothing new was in the new
While on the flames hed drop unseen
While on the floor Triquets at rest
While on the last one youll uncover
While past its glassedin windows flitter
While picking berries filled the air
While some rude Cyclops at his fire
While spinning round in bright red hat
While taking leave Tatyana hovered
While thinking under every sigh
While thoughts of money filled his head
While through the glass his mother scowls
While travelling near that selfsame sea
While we the foes of Hymens banner
While women wept and doctors frowned
While yet a foreign language slips
Whists heroes have by now completed
Who cooled off love with separation
Who doesnt find dissembling dreary
Who gained in turn without regrets
Who hates all gestures each warm word
Who haunts your thoughts and writers quill
Who in an aimless idle fix
Who is she though My wife old boy
Who joked both cleverly and wryly
Who late at night are whisked away
Who learned to bear without surrender
Who loves you more than I must sign
Who never drained lifes chalice dry
Who never knew exotic visions
Who never risked his sound estate
Who plays an unwed fathers role
Who rests within the hearts sweet places
Who ruled the queenly Nevas shore
Who takes cold intellect for naught
Who taught her then this soft surrender
Who turns each morning into night
Who was at twenty fop or swell
Who was it you were dreaming of
Who wont betray us in the end
Who wont sow slander all about us
Who would have thought How long its been
Who wouldnt grow fatigued with rages
Who yawned with wife and friends exempt
Whod ask for more The world could tell
Whod dare to seek the tender maiden
Whod dreamt and loved was born once more
Whod killed his friend for satisfaction
Wholl coddle us and never doubt us
Wholl never bore us through and through
Whos cross with everything about
Whos standing there in conversation
Whose authors powers of depiction
Whose cordial hand shall then be led
Whose form in pensive adoration
Whose gaze evoking inspiration
Whose head is never fancystirred
Whose heart  experience has cooled
Whose peasants lead a wretched life
Whose potent light in all its lustre
Whose turbid streams flow down and cluster
Why I can picture theminspired
Why Ive seen ladies so complacent
Why all these yawns Onegin Really
Why argue vainly with the season
Why did you ever come to call
Why did you leave last night so early
Why here he is Monsieur Guillot
Why mark me out for your attention
Why murmur vainly He cant give
Why my dear lady whats the bother
Why my good husbands sainted mother
Why no one friends as Gods my witness
Why not I like its intonation
Why not at all they just intend
Why not at allWell serves you right
Why notWere I the poet brother
Why pretty one youre up already
Why she who with a wistful air
Why spend your efforts all in vain
Why sweetheart anything you choose
Will be quite pleased to greet I know
Will change beyond all recognition
Will claim what happy days remain
Will cross our Russia far and wide
Will draw her leather reins up tightly
Will drown my memorys brief existence
Will earn me an indulgent gaze
Will freedom comeand cut my tether
Will on some future day relate
Will point my portrait out and plead
Will strain to hear with bated breath
Will stride in broadly arching sweep
Will you at last cut memorys thread
With God knows whom on every side
With Olgaall confused and shook
With Russian pancakes Russian cheer
With Tanyas aunt a kind relation
With all her marble beautys fire
With all my love till death us parts 
With all my soul your perfect grace
With all of life before it yet
With all the nonsense lovers sing
With all the surgings of your heart
With apprehensive step    then fled
With banal ladies men who shout
With bark of pugs and maidens joys
With carefree charm and winsome air
With children of all shapes and ages
With choral songas theyd been bidden
With conscience as his judge of right
With dawns first rays Tatyana races
With decks of cards of every type
With drooping head and frequent yawning
With epigrams of spite and daring
With evenings gloom the day has set  
With every tribute he can find
With far too many foreign loans
With fiery praise    and heated sighs
With flashes of his sudden wit
With folded arms along the hall
With gaze of keen commiseration
With golden crosses emberbright
With grammar may delight us all
With grandams and granduncles gaily
With her old friend My little dove
With him amid the frosty gloom
With his Ochkov decoration
With his enraptured poets pen
With his immoral soul disclosed
With humble roots and servants hall
With joy his heart anticipated
With jug in hand the milkmaid hurries
With just a dash of lemon flavour
With just two balls and blunted cue
With kindly neighbours sometimes present
With laughter kisses din and hustle
With lots of jam and talk to spare
With loving eyes that seek you gladly
With meaning for our Russian hearts
With men he knew or friends he spied
With mighty Russian hammer whacks
With misty eyes he looks on sweetly
With mournful air and brooding glance
With nasty gossip or a jest   
With native glibness from their lips
With negligent lorgnettes in view
With no great palaces no streets
With no great sense of deprivation
With no reply He drives dejected
With notes that run to seven pages
With nothing that it must regret
With olden days beyond recall
With other capers such as courting
With our Zaretsky at a distance
With passions game we both were sated
With pictures of a happy pair
With quiet firm and measured tread
With rules traditions ancient ways
With secret meanings theyd impart
With shouts of joy and welcome cheer
With shouts of joy on either side
With sighs of passion and with praise
With silence and in meditation
With sinless dreams of sweet delight
With slippers and a dressing jacket
With sock in hand he led the way
With something of his true complexion
With sparkling wine for us to savour
With spellings awesome in abusage
With spring he felt rejuvenated
With stern behaviours grim attack
With stillness stars the lonely night
With such a lively mind and will
With such a rashness in surrender
With sweetly flaming loves refrain
With tea too sweet to be inviting
With tender soul and manly grace
With tenderness and pain imbued
With those whod known the now deceased
With throbbing head about to split
With us the words an innovation
With vain pursuit of worldly ends
With verse in hand looks Tanyas way
With visions of some distant place
With watchful mothers aunts who stare
With what a tempest of desire
With what a vivid fascination
With what celestial pride she grazes
With what delight I praise those hours
With which my novel took its start
With whom today were rather bored
With wicked grin or solemn eye
With winters brilliant rug of snow
Within a book her hearts extremes
Within a cool and leafy nook
Within a dream to which we cling
Within five hundred years about
Within her heart the frenzied beating
Within his soul must hold men small
Within me now they are no more
Within my soul will fade and dwindle
Within the Russian tradition the scope of Pushkins achievement is essentially clear and well established He is unarguably a figure of protean dimensions the author in his own right of a formidable and enduring body of work and at the same time the seminal writer whose example has nourished enriched and in large part directed all subsequent literature in the language He came of age at a historical moment when the Russian literary language after a century or so of imitation of foreign models had been roughly shaped and readied for the hand of an original genius Pushkin was to fulfil that role
Within the witching webs we spin
Within this breast no longer young
Within this strange new domicile
Within those empty halls ornate
Within those waves each martyred soul
Without a doubt a full translation
Without a forewords interference
Without a word the lady shuns him
Without position work or wife
Without response and takes no part
Without surprise or indignation
Without them my Onegins fashioned
Wolff t Pushkin on Literature London 
Wont call me sir the way he should
Wont kiss a ladys hand the mocker
Wont let the traveller sleep at all
Would be the bride Id make my own
Would call Praskvya chre Pauline
Would chase sweet vanity again
Would dine with him in winter here
Would fail to touch my heart at all
Would hear the bailiff give his orders
Would just have been the death of me
Would light the way with secret stories
Would like to bid his heir adieu
Would listen gravely to the end
Would listen with a look intense
Would mend lifes thread and make it whole
Would muse on passions and their flights
Would oft recite his eyes ablaze
Would one day shine upon our race
Would praise him for his nasty grit
Would stop her now for no good reason
Would take my merry Muse along
Would thank his stars to be so blest
Would touch obliquely on the point
Would whisper it her secret prayer

Yazykov N M Yazykov  a minor poet and acquaintance of Pushkin
Yes he was loved   beyond deceiving   
Yes soon he lost all warmth of feeling
Yet I in futile dullness squander 
Yet distant hopes within me dreaming
Yet even in these same afflictions
Yet in its mirror not reflecting
Yet neither Virgils nor Racines
Yet not replaced you after all
Yet once hed moved her heart to tears
Yet still Onegin slumbers deeply
Yet wasnt like so many blind
Yet were not morals ill affected
You came to me in nuptial splendour
You cannot know Im so alone 
You cherished dreams of sacred worth
You dropped in twice and closed the book
You epicures and sages you
You filled my dreams and sweetest trances 
You fledglings from our Lyvshins crew
You fortunate procrastinators
You futile searching phantombreeder
You gorgeous albums stamped with gilt
You had no use for my devotion   
You have been out of circulation
You know him then Well yes and no
You know these days Im not so clear
You learn lifes sweetness    feel its kiss
You left no prints no pressings tender
You libraries of darkest Hades
You loved instead to come and go
You lover of the Muses art 
You may have sought in these reflections
You mourn the poet friends    and rightly
You mustnt think    and please dont worry   
You ought to really    theyll be flattered
You pitied then my girlish dreams   
You poets who have sinned unduly
You rustic Priams from the cities
You stayed his friends despite all this
You stirred me with your wondrous glances
You too have known such belles before
You too indulgent reader hurry
You too you mamas I commend you
You too young mistresses of leisure
You volumes nimbly ornamented
You were the first that he forswore
You wont abandon me I know 
You wont be pleased to see it done
You wrote to me Do not deny it
Youd start to weep but all your crying
Youll be my guardian till the end   
Youll fall in love again but learn   
Youll meet the haughty Slav the Greek
Youll never guess    its watershort
Youll read no doubt fond protestations
Young Lensky came to cast an eye
Young Lensky seemed the perfect catch
Young Olgas friends to spend the day
Young Tanya my enchanted dreamer
Young lifes own whirlwind full of sound
Young maidens find quick consolation
Young maidens hushed in passing by her
Your Grandison I never knew   
Your Olgas look is cold and dead
Your candour has a great appeal
Your cheeks are poppies now my pet
Your claim upon its joyous duties
Your elegy lacks all perception
Your endless croakings and gyrations
Your fateful tempters figure lies
Your frigid glance    that sermonette   
Your genius for a worthy end
Your haughty glance may well express
Your interest piqued and doubtless growing
Your knees    and sobbing at your feet
Your mount if put to try his paces
Your noble thoughts and simple ways
Your solemn gaze may only spy
Your tears and rhymes and whatyouwill
Your tears in fact would only gall
Your trusting soul   and sweet devotion
Your valleys woods and hamlets seemed
Your verses limpid live complexion
Your virtues are a vain temptation
Your voice within my soul rang clear    
Youre burning upOh do be still
Youre just not well youre overheated
Youre like a comrade ever steady
Youre married ReallyOn my honour
Youre now subdued you vaulting schemes
Youre right And will you point with praises
Youre still my little early bird
Youre sure to find there decorations
Youve been invited there next week
Youve found at least a crumb or two
Youve guessed already Yes indeed
Youve now resigned to him your fate
Youve paid your due to follies past

any milieu He is enormously alive to the ephemera of experience fascinated by everything and everyone the sublime and the ridiculous the sacred and the profane all the roles that people play and every style of behaviour he is interested equally in the talented and the mediocre in the articulate and the dumb in Czars peasants soldiers fops rakes society women vulnerable girls rascals villains and almost anyone else He wants if only fleetingly to capture everything to absorb it all in his appetite for lifeeven at the risk of losing himself or perhaps out of the need to lose himself And the vision that emerges from this fleeting race through experience is no less perceptive and suggestive than many more lengthy examinations of life Pushkins manner of describing phenomena is fleeting and abrupt because he is never sated never content never willing to stay in one place he has to rush on to the next person or thing that catches his eye His omnivorous curiosity lends a kind of lightness as well as universality to Pushkins worka lightness of touch weight and illumination The quality is legendary in descriptions of Pushkins art but it can be mistaken for superficiality Our elusive author appears to take few things seriously not excluding himself and often poses as a mere entertainer Entertaining he certainly is but if we as readers are taken in by his ruse and allow ourselves to become inattentive we are in danger of missing the subtle and hidden aspect of his art
artists emblem for the native sources of his poetry or as an avatar of his art itself She is a figure who though unhappy and unfree like Pushkin himself remains steadfast in her adherence to values beyond the gratifications of the self There is an undeniable sadness in this sparkling novel especially at its end If it opened to the tune of a sprightly scherzo it closes to the strains of a somewhat mournful adagio Pain and disappointment have a prominent place in the world of Onegin but so too does the celebration of life in all its enticing minutiae and thus the novel gives us neither a conventionally happy nor a conventionally unhappy ending It avoids to be sure any overt statement of tragedy for the hero and heroine still live are indeed still relatively young Their stories abruptly abandoned in typically Pushkinian fashion remain incomplete their ultimate fates still unresolved In his final chapter does Pushkin even try to rescue his hapless hero from the shallowness of his egoism Does he seek to make him worthy through his suffering of someones if not Tatyanas love Could the tale that unwinds beyond the pages of the book be resumed could it take unexpected turns and move in new directions are other outcomes possible One suspects despite the aesthetically pleasing roundedness of the poem that the answers are yes that other roads lie ahead for the heroes that life still beckons In his generosity of spirit the author gives to his characters and thereby to himself the possibility of renewal The concluding chapters of Eugene Onegin are Pushkins farewell to his poetic youth Henceforth in his effort to reinvent himself and as a sign of his commitment to become yet more fully engaged in the life of literature he would devote his energies mainly to prose For Pushkin however to cease completely to be a poet was to die and in his novel in verse he announces a continuing will to live Lifes chalice he tells us in its final stanza never runs dry lifes novel which the artist both reads and writes never comes to an end for the taker of risks

by many as a classic instance of the untranslatable work Vladimir Nabokov has argued that a literal rendering of Pushkins sentences is about the best that can be achieved or even honestly attempted that any translation that retains the originals metre and rhyme since it cannot be faithful to the works exact meaning will necessarily result in a mere paraphrase In his own translation of the novel which he proudly labelled  pony he shunned accordingly both metre and rhyme and gave us a version at once marvellously accurate and rather peculiar most of its poetry resident in the accompanying commentary rather than in the translation itself Pushkin one has to say loses where Nabokov gains And of course a literal version is in the end no less unfaithful to its model than a rhymed and metred one in place of a work whose austere and harmonious shape is an essential part of its effect it gives us something illproportioned and flaccid a kind of formal paraphrase that seems bland and inert where the original is expressive and alive But the translators dilemma doesnt lie really in choosing between faithfulness to form and faithfulness to meaning for in fact neither of these goals even separately is attainable In the transfer of a work from one language to another there are no exact correspondences to be found neither in the meanings and histories of words nor in the intricacies and effects of forms This very tendency of ours to divide a work of art into separate categories of form and content not only gives a false view of a works complex nature but also poses the problem of literary translation in a false light

exalted utterance by strange gods yet remaining at an everyday level the most insignificant of humans a misfit and outcast Far from being in propria persona a poetic demiurge the poet is the instrument and voice of powers beyond the self This is a conception of the poet that combines elements of both a romantic and an antiromantic sensibility It yokes together two disparate images that of the divinely inspired seer and that of the human misfit It is a vision of course with ancient roots and in its specifically Russian variant with links to the native tradition of the jurodivy the wandering holy fool of popular veneration For Pushkin such an image of the poet provides a justification for asserting at once an enormous arrogance for his art and a fundamental humility toward his gift And perhaps it helps to explain the peculiar instability and elusiveness of Pushkins artistic personality the odd sense his reader has that the author is both palpably present in his work and yet nowhere to be found We seldom know directly what this author thinks even about seemingly obvious things and we are made uneasy by this lack of a familiar and reassuring human intelligence The point is not that Pushkin leaves a great deal to the readers creativity and perception though he does but rather that his genius is to an unusual extent of a peculiarly negative kind He is that rare artist who possesses to an extreme degree a kind of splendid receptivity an ability to absorb and embody the very energy of his surroundings to take into himself with an amazing sympathy all the shapes and colours of the life that he sees and hears and responds to He may or he may not examine intellectually the life that he describes he may or he may not admire it or approve of it but what he must do is reveal it recreate it in its vivacity display his sheer perception of it refraining from an easy human judgement

inventiveness in the writers who followed him and his modernization of the diction and syntax of literary texts with infusions of living contemporary speech pointed the way to a perennial renewal of the literary language In the area of literary subjectmatter as well his influence was farreaching he introduced a host of suggestive themes that later writers would explore more fully and he greatly enlarged the cast of characters in serious literature No topic or person lay beyond the reach of his interest his poetry and prose are filled with lifes essential concerns and activitieswith love work art history politics and nature with all the mundane trivia of everyday existence and with the more rarefied realm of dreams and thoughts He virtually created and shaped modern Russian literature and in countless ways determined the course it would follow after him

literary sophistication and complexity and the fact of its having been written in verse it may be more accessible to the appreciation of nonRussian readers than most of Pushkins other work Almost all of us even those who are resistant to poetry especially in translation are readers of novels and Pushkins long poem with its stanzas that mimic paragraphs and its verse that seems as natural as familiar prose subtly entices us by its successful masquerade as a novel The writer spent some eight years writing it far longer than he devoted to any other work and it thus accompanied him through an extended and crucial period of his life It not only reflects the vital changes that were taking place in Pushkin himself during those years but it also represents its authors response to a transformation in the general literary climate By the late s the rage was all for new works in prose rather than poetry and although Russian literature had as yet produced few prose works of any lasting distinction writers were eager to answer the demands of the time Pushkin was among the first of the established authors to respond to the need for a serious prose literature This change in public taste and Pushkins effort to respond to it took place in the very years when the writer was composing Eugene Onegin Begun when Pushkin was only  still ebullient in his poetic personality and still partially under the sway of his fascination with Byron it was completed in his thirtysecond year when he was already the author of several prose works of a strongly antiromantic cast Onegin as the works hybrid nature suggests belongs to a transitional phase in Pushkins career and constitutes a kind of bridge linking two literary eras It shows us its author at the central period of his life in the very act of crossing that bridge attempting to transform himself from romantic poet into a novelist who would paint on a large canvas an expansive picture of social reality Paradoxically Eugene Onegin although written in verse is the earliest of Pushkins works to contain a major component of the prosaic in motivation and spirit This rather complex set of personal and historical factors informs this first great
milieu of aristocratic society and at a time when poetry rather than prose was the dominant mode for high literature Well read in both the ancient classics and in Western European literature especially French literature of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries Pushkin was the most dazzlingly talented member of a younger generation of writers who were attempting under the banner of romanticism to reform and invigorate the language and the styles of poetry If Pushkins early work he began composing as a schoolboy prodigy was facile and conventional consisting mainly of light verse suitable for the literary salons of the day frothy Epicurean pieces witty epigrams album verse it already displayed an impressive plasticity of language that was new in Russian literature and quite soon he exhibited a mastery of virtually all the poetic genres and styles known to the writers of his era The eventual range of his creativity was enormous embracing not only all the prevailing forms of lyric verse which he reshaped into his own freer medium of expression but including brilliant examples of narrative verse as well He also achieved stunning success in poetry based on the idioms and themes of Russian folklore and he experimented fascinatingly in the field of verse drama both on a large Shakespearian scale and in intensely concentrated minimalist studies of human passions He is in sum a poet of astonishing versatility Possessed of a uniquely supple linguistic instrument he is the master of an apparently effortless naturalness a seamless blend of appropriate sound sense and feeling During the last decade of his life when literary activity was being democratized and commercialized and when a larger more broadly based readership was emerging Pushkin turned increasingly to prose which was fast outdistancing poetry in popularity though it had yet to achieve the same high level of excellence attained by Russian verse Pushkins prose fiction which is characterized by an unusual terseness and precision of expression includes several masterpieces in the shortstory form one completed historical novel as well as the beginnings of several others and a number of unfinished drafts of a

outrageous behaviour and he enjoyed flirting recklessly with the dangers of a dissolute and dissident life Upon leaving school he put on briefly the mask of political rebel and quite consciously provoked with several courageous poems of liberal sentiment the displeasure of the emperor for which he was punished with removal from the centres of Russian culture and power Even then in banishment he courted further punitive action from the authorities by circulating verse of blasphemous if humorous content

reflections of literary stereotypes Literary art and language itself in their view are always selfreferential uninvolved in any realities supposed to exist outside the work Such readings also face difficulties and complications Pushkins fictional heroes are themselves avid readers of fiction they construct their identities as much from books as from available social roles Onegin in resisting the constrictions of social conventions adopts the dissident poses of dandy and cynic but these are only further conventional masks disguises borrowed from books Onegins lack of a solid identity becomes clear to the reader and to Tatyana within the novel itself with the realization that he is mostly a congeries of literary affectations a parody he has modelled himself on the currently fashionable Byronic type while at the same time he appears in Tatyanas vivid literary imagination as the thrilling hero of a Gothic romance Pushkin has great satirical fun in playing with these various literary echoes and he has his hero more empty shell than either rebel or demon confront his fate not in a romantically primordial wilderness but in the homely setting of a Russian country estate Similarly Tatyana though less parodied by the author because she is capable of genuine feeling is composed of a number of literary and cultural personae To the narrator she contains elements of the savage female a being untouched by civilizations denaturing forces a fantasy of many male romantic writers to Onegin when he first encounters her she is merely a naive provincial girl and by the novels end she is for both Onegin and her new aristocratic milieu the very embodiment of a successful society hostess and legislatrix Tatyana too confronts her fate in a kind of literary parody she discovers the true nature of her hero not by a passage into the dark recesses of a medieval castle but by reading Onegins books in his abandoned country house itself a symbol of the heros vacancy
