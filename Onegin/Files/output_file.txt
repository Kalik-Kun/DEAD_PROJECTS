A
A London dandy, hair all curled,
A Moscow winter would be nice.
A Muscovite in Harold's cloak,
APPENDIX
A Quaker? Bigot?might one ask?
A Russian family's age-old story,
A Venus temple, graves and greenery;
A backwoods genius, he commuted
Abandon Hope, Who Enter Here!
A beauty languid and enchanted!
A beetle hummed. The peasant choirs
A bit provincial and affected,
A blessed and most favoured land!
A blessing bountiful and tender
A bloody roastbeef's on the table,
A bloody spectre seemed to rise;
A bold kibitka skips and burrows
A bold mazurka grips the crowd,
A bold reply, too blunt a frown,
A book of Schiller's from the rack;
A bottle of some sparkling wine,
About her clothes one couldn't fault her;
About the olden days . . . you know,
About the stable, many cried;
About this unknown belle he'd found.
Above a tambour to enrich
Above his bed and holds him fast.
Above my bed, a gentle lover,
Above our waters iron bridges
Above some letter that she's reading
Above the Neva's placid water
Above the chessboard deep in thought,
Above their brows the sign of Hades:
Above the lonely sea . . . and then
Above the mist. And now the stream
A brace of pistols and a shot
A brazen chap all starched and proud,
A breath of warmth. The pipe smoke passes
A broken fence, a wicket gate,
(A broken set, but he was thrifty);
Absorbed his soul... as he was shown:
Abused him roundly, used the knife.
A butterfly in blooms of May;
A call to ring throughout the ages.
A captive of his lot and duty,
A careless drawl, a tiny stutter,
A cause for all the monde to tattle
A cause for solemn satisfaction,
Accepting hostage bonds with rapture
Accept my thanks and admiration,
A charming fool at love's vocation,
A charming lad, though somewhat wild.
A child herself, for children's fun
A clump of snow will fall and glimmer.
A coldly jealous, selfish brute!
A contest for his crown ... or thine,
A cottage with two rowans yonder,
A couch, two cupboards, and a table,
A country house ... a windowsill. . .
A country missinfatuated,
A country squire, there he stands,
A crab upon a spider sat;
A craving for a change of air
Across from Tanyathere they place them;
A cross not many choose to bear).
Across the misted panes a row
Across the river, smoky fires
Across these once imperilled passes.
A crowd of slaves on every side?
A curious and keen lorgnette
A dactyl from an anapest.
A dark and seething torrent races,
Adds colour lightly and with love;
A deathly pallor merely covered
A dinner fanciful and idle,
A disenchanted opera glass,
A distance luminous and boundless. . . .
A distant and secluded nook
Adorned the course of rural leisure
A drawn-out tale of fancies grand,
Adrift in idle, slothful ways;
A drink of lingonberry flavour.
A due respect for his afflictions
A fair Venetian at my side,
A faithful friend, a peaceful squire,
A family with a single creed,
A feast of youthful fancies free,
A fervent author used to show
A final and complete relief.
A fleeing hare would cross her way,
A fool, at eighteen years of age,
Afraid the scoundrel might refuse
A freedom-loving, noble heart,
A friend of mine, whom you. . . correctly! 
A frosty night, the sky resplendent
A funeral verse for his old friend.
Again he'd done his moral duty,
Against a sky all blue and tender
Against the heavens' pallid glow,
Against the rampart's granite shelf,
Against the ramrods mallets pound.
Against the will, inside their brains
A gambler and a guards cadet.
A garden by the glinting river.
A glance in any other book.
A gloried name; his silenced lyre
A glutton, grafter, and buffoon.
A goateed witch is on a mop;
A golden, sparkling fine champagne,
A greybeard too . . . with scented hair,
A grizzled Kalmuk came to meet them;
Ah, Moscow! How that sound is freighted
A happy and immortal breed,
A harvest brief, each generation,
A haughty skeleton sits pouting
Ah, blest indeed . . . although it's true,
Ah, dearest feet, where have you vanished?
Ah, friends, I too have been delighted
Ah, friends, those friends! I greatly fear,
'Ah me, these poets . . . such a hurry!'
A hoary frothing wave that strains
A horde of monsters in a ring:
A horse of spirit fit to bridle,
A hot pursuit of flaming glances;
A housewife now is what I treasure;
Ah, then, perhaps, the love she bore
A huge and matted bear appeared!
A hunter hidden in the brush
'Ah, whither, whither are ye banished,
Ah, wintertime! . . . The peasant, cheerful,
Ah yes, he loved in such a fashion
Ai* I find is much too risky,
A is like a mistressfrisky,
A jutting branch looms up, attacking,
A kerchief on her grizzled head,
A lady's love, I say to you,
A laid-out corpse was what he found,
A lancer has enthralled her deep,
A lancer whom she loves with passion;
A land by which the mind is fired:
Alas! His fiance has scorned him
Alas, Tatyana's fading quickly;
Alas! Upon life's furrowed plain
Alas! We humans all ignore
Alas, it isn't hard to guess!
Alas! it's true: Eugene's demented,
(Alas, too salty); now they're bringing,
Alas, with well-deserved derision!
A laudable and worthy goal.
A learned, if pedantic, sort.
A lexicon of words in vogue . . .
A liar still, Lyubv Petrvna;
A linen cloth with silken stitch.
A line or two of Virgil's art.
A little learning means a lot.
A little maiden's meek affection
A little walk, some rest and play;
A lively, varied atmosphere.
Alive once more and free at last,
A living picture's pallid double,
All Europespecious wines to offer;
All ancient folklore night and noon,
All around
All bustle round and lie like cheats,
All cross themselves and dig right in.
All day, all night, in sleep's embrace
All dressed since dawn, dead-pale and sighing,
All elegiac play aside That now indeed my spring has died
All evening Lensky was abstracted,
(All futures seemed alike in woe)
All girlish fainting-fits and tears,
All gone are youth's bright years of grace,
All hooves and trunksgrotesque and curving,
All innocence, their talk progresses .
All jealousy and rage departed
All laugh and argue, squeal and shout.
All lost in thought, the gentle lass
All objects either scared or charmed her
All other days they've our permission
All poets, I need hardly mention,
All point at her and all combine
All race about on some affair.
All rise; he marches to the door.
All round the nomad-tented land
All sad and silent like Svetlana*
All sentiments and deem men zeros
All signs and portents quite alarmed her,
All sons of boredom's endless greed.
All's quiet now. Inside the parlour,
All that a poet's soul might cherish:
All these our dreamy maiden's ardour
All these were new and unexpected,
All this I now can let you know,
All this adorned his dressing room,
All this, dear readers, meant in fine:
All this, of course, can help impart
All this today seems antiquated
All thoughts of time returninggroundless;
All tragico-hysteric moaning,
All vain and languorous with pride,
All victims: someof war's distress,
All weeds. No wreath is on the bough;
All wet, comes off in crumbly snow;
Alone amid his new possessions,
Alone, and sunk in calculation,
Alone, beside the windowcase,
Alone both day and night through life;
A lonely boat would sail along,
Alone the shepherd, grey and weary,
Alone upon his way he goes
Along a forest road he surges,
Along a street that gently drowses,
Along the Neva's bank by sleigh.
Along the Petersburg chausse
Along the merry streets you'll hear
Along with fashions long since dead:
A lover's secret assignation . . .
Already bored, to uncle's bed,
Already cross and irritated
Already has she mastered guile,
Already learned to cheat and smile!
'Alright, I'll go.' 'Well done, first class!'
Although Eugene with care inspected
Although Onegin's inclination
Although her tears were all too brief!
Although he seldom saw their sense.
(Although he thought him lacking heart),
Although the book she read presented
Although to us they're hardly new.
A magic night, the moon's embrace. . . .
A maiden's foreign words of passion
A maiden's looking-glass she keeps.
A maiden somewhat ripe in glow,
A manor house and grove below,
A man whose heart and soul and mind
A mere exchange of looks conveyed
A mere self-portrait in the end;
Amid his conquests of the hour?
Amid his feasts to no avail?
Amid his pleasures and their blaze,
Amid its magic brooks and quarters
Amid its park. In sombre dress
Amid our forbears' vaunted day;
Amid the drifting, snowbound spaces
Amid the stillness of the night,
Amid the tumult and the still,
Amid this peaceful life they cherished,
Amid this world's deceptive glitter,
Amid those mournful crags on high,
A misty dream of what might be.
A moment's thought whose trace shall last
Among themselves they put her down.
Among the pines would gently turn
A monster of Satanic feature,
(A most unfortunate condition
Am quite as glad to write as you,
Am quite content to read for hours
A murmur through the ballroom steals . . .
Amusement's yield, the careless fruit
An aged uncle'sin my book;
An always bold, impassioned speech,
A nameless river's placid scene,
And Anna Pvlovna, as ever,
And Benedetto* he'd intone
And Christendom will institute
And Egypt's son as well you'll see,
And Flora's cheek, I quite agree;
And Flynov, who'd been reeling badly-
And Gallicisms in a sentence
And Good and Evil, Life and Fate
And Grandison, the noble lord
And Ialas, I must confess
And I as yet could not uncover
And I can hear your stern reply.
And I confess, from them I fled,
And I confess (in public sorrow)
And I lament old sorrows yet.
And I'll be faithful all my life.'
And I'm deprived of this; for you 
And I'm not loathe to let it go;
And I must die without a moan. 
And I, recalling poor Svetlana,*
And I so meekly heard you preach?
And I surrender to my fate.
And I was just thirteen that year.
And I, who saw my single duty
And Lensky falls; the shadows thicken;
And Lensky formed a low opinion
And Lensky too; a light shines out;
And Moscow countless beauties too;
And Olga too; Eugene alertly
(And Olga too!) an invitation;
And Petushkv as well went under.
And Strasbourg pie,* that deathless fable;
And Tanya, now no longer quaking,
And Tanya sees with trepidation
And Tanya's youth now glimmers darkly:
And Werther, that rebellious martyr,
And all around her, dully gleaming,
And all its solid form reflected
And all that crowd of local rabble.'
And all that final summer season
And all that quickens and excites,
And all the ditches that abound
And all the hilltops soft and glowing
And all the monsters fled the room;
And all the social rabble snatches;
And all the while her soul was aching,
And all the while she guards her heart
And all the while the moon was shining
And all the world in silence lay
And all the yearnings in our breast,
And all those beauties, once appealing,
And all we've learned from its great store
And all worn out, she wept a bit,
And almost even left her spouse;
And almost fall; the poor thing's ready
And analyst of dreams unclear.
And antiquated turns of phrase
And apropos, I might make mention
And are your kinfolk well today?
And arguments, and happy times!
And armed with your good staff, 
And arm in arm, they seek their chairs:
And artifice that ladies share
And as I watch them disappearing,
And as he bid the girl goodnight,
And as his years of youth abated,
And asks the stranger passing by,
And as she gazed upon that place
And as she reads, a tear will rise
And at a walk she'll ride, dejected,
And ate and drank in just his robe.
And at her frightened cry a troop
And at the altar by his side,
And at their table guests were served
And back at home she's overdue
And bade the envoy, if he cared,
And barely stir, all weighted down
And barred from being loved ... or fooled!
And barren age has shown its face,
And beats an iridescent wing
And be avenged that very day.
And beckon to each passing sail.
And been a faithful wife and mother,
And been as happy ... as I could!
And beg you for your kind protection. 
And bending, whispers her gallantly
And bids us cast away the crown
And bid us thuswise to renew
And bind him tighter with our rope;
And blest the dark that comes to stay!
And blest who ripened in his prime;
And blest with all its cares the day,
And blind as ever, still believing,
And boldly put for 'belle Nina'
And bows he'd mastered absolutely.
And breathes upon the chilly glass;
And brilliant day begin to bloom;
And brings in merry mood before her
And brought along Monsieur Triquet,
And by the Heavens was endowed
And by the country tavern door
And by the matchwood's crackling light
And by the moonlit grave they kept
And, by these coastal cliffs enthralled,
And by the window read it through.
And cannot ever read my fill.
And caped in storms, shall I go questing
And captures worldly fame to boot!
And cattle wand'ring o'er the lea;
And chase from nearby hills the snow,
And cheek in hand as down she peers,
And claps salute him. Tanya feels
And cleanse this Chapter Five at last
And cleared the darkened mind she found.
And climbed a gentle hill by night.
And coachmen by the fire's glow
And, cold himself, gave warmth its due.
And come to know a new regret;
And commerce reigns in all the streets
And could she now have been so bold,
And countless tearsthe gentle balm
And country dress would find no mercy;
And cracked and waved its sails while prancing;
And crosses dense with flocks of daws.
And cursing woman's crooked course,
And cuts the ice with ringing skates;
And cutting off Eugene's reply,
And damns his folly in these matters
And damns their idle ways and patter,
And deep within her rustic bower,
And distant lands where once he'd shed
And does not heed my present woes.
(And does so still, have no illusion)
And down he goes! The first snow flurries
And drink the draught of love's temptations,
And driven home alone to bed.
And driven home to change and preen.
And drops of tears . . . while on a hassock,
And drove back home, immersed in thought;
And drowsy nature, smiling lightly,
And each takes pistol into hand.
And early church bellswhen they chime,
And earn me tribute paid to fame:
And economics he knew well;
And ended up the dunce instead.
And enigmatic Sbogar* too.
And enmity with harsh contempt;
And entertain the nearly dead,
And even in their slander dreary.
And even now, my dearest vision,
And even part whole mountain ridges;
And even simple-minded fun
And even there it seems to win.
And ever brighter, brighter grow.
And ever faster on she reels;
And everyone who chose to speak
And face to face with his own soul,
And fame's delicious agitation
And famous!' But the plaintive measure
And far aheadCaucasian masses.
And far from town now set your course!
And far niente rules my leisures:
And fear assails her; in a panic
And feel a deep commiseration;
And feverish with lyric vision,
And filled my soul with dreams, content.
And filled with truth's own vivid glows
And, filling all his meditations,
And fill the page that follows mine.'
And finally left it when they bought
And find the country unappealing; 
And fled afar . . . and she as well.
And fled the woods' and fields' seclusion,
And flies uphill with all his speed;
And flock to tranquil wisdom's crest;
And, following the old tradition,
And fondly watched her girlhood games;
And former couns'lor, old man Flynov,
And for us both, ahead there waited
And for which song he paid at last
And found in one a list of wages,
And found their solemn conversations
And found the source of lyric fire
And fresh new linen from the bin.
And friendly husbands hard to bear!
And friends and friendship less intriguing;
And from one charming foot her slipper,
And from the hut come cries and din;
And full of doubt, her spirits sinking,
And fumed in sullen indignation;
And gallops off. Now nothing mattered
And gave the neighbours equal reason
And gave the neighbours quite a treat.
And, gazing at the moon, she'd nourished
And gazing softly, she embraces
And girls prefer 'The Kitty's Song.'*
And glances slyly through the door.
And glidesso peaceful and transcendent. . . .
And good and bad all intertwine.
And grandly you'll see winter through!
And grant the world redeeming grace.*
And grim repentance gnaws his heart.
And gusting snowflakes flash and spin,
And had, it's true, no inclination
And halt the constant surge of blushes;
'And happiness was ours ... so nearly!
And happy, he'd have learned life truly;
And hasn't stirred; still slumber hovers
And hasten rather to forestall
And haughty dames . . . then calmly stops
And haunt their dreams. They worship now
And have they not, the charming fools,
And he, alas, by friend lies killed!
And hearing my sweet stanzas soar,
And he believed that men would tender
And held my flaming bosom fast!
And here Mickiwicz* sang inspired,
And here ... at this unhappy turn
And he recalled Tatyana's pallor,
And he recalled, at least in part,
And he recalled with grim emotion,
And here great Mithridates* died,
And here's Oneginliberated,
And here's Oneginlord and master
And here's Petrvsky Castle,* hoary
And here's Prolzov,* celebrated
And here's a chap whose words are biting,
And here's a household boy gone sleighing
And here's an envoy speaking slyly
'And here's my Tanya.' 'Lord, it's ages!
'And here's the hearth,' spoke up the crone,
And here's the master's study, dear;
And him for whom, by fate's command,
And his sad fate drew us apart. ..
And his sly odist in The Other* 
And hold a placid conversation!. . .
And hold the lucky stirrup steady,
And honest virtue won the day.
And honoured patron of the barre
'And how are our dear neighbours faring?
And how he'd seize a moment's weakness
And how his wicked tongue would gore him!
And how's the plague? What conflagrations,
And how the ladies' eyes he lit
And human speech and hoofbeat taps!
And humble lot he'd once rejected? . . .
And hung the limbs of oaks with white;
And if it is, who wants to know?)
And ill at ease, he scarcely tries
And in a letter, rash and green,
And in a trice they seat the pair.
And in deceit will take no part?
And in exchange he also took
And in her gaudy mantle rages
And in her hands a French romance.
And in her heart the thought was planted . . .
And in her native tongue, I fear,
And in my garden* she appeared
And in my heart I cried: It's he!
And innocence can lead to woe.'
And in the country he'd have worn
And in the end were close as brothers.
And in their dens bewailed as one
And in their singsong tones impart
And in the margins she inspected
And in the morning he won't know
And in the next an almanac
And in the novel's final pages,
And in the princess then, who wouldn't
And in the solitude her passion
And in the tomb his shade shall never
And in the wings . . . the assignations?
And in this poet's cup of mine
And in those days when I was blest,
And introduced a new regime.
And in your coming, God has spoken, 
And irked by fleet success soon after,
And is there no return of youth?
And it may touch some heart with fire;
And jealous anguish pierced her breast
And judge her harshly from the start:
And judge me both by word and deed.
And keep to silent meditation;
And land of harsh, forbidding places;
And later secretly demean them
And late the lazy East still slumbers
And laughs out loud between his howls,
And lays her down upon the floor.
And lays her on a makeshift bed,
And leave him, reader, at his station. . .
And leave no trace, however slender.
And leaves her languid soul ignited:
And left Eugene in mute dismay.
And left her husband at a loss.
And left them too without vexation,
And letters in a maiden's hand.
And let the conversation die.
And life went smoothly after that.
And lifting up her veil, she'll read
And lighter than a swallow, saying:
And, lightly clad, would take a stroll
And liked his common sense in part.
And like the family circle's charm;
And listen for the heart's first beat,
And loathes the awful thing he's done.
And loathes this world with all her being;
And locked him in a darkened den.
And lo! my beauty calmly passes
And long he stood in sorrow aching;
And long she stood, bewitched and glowing,
And long she watched the road they'd taken,
And long since time, I'm sure you'd say!
And looked about, perplexed and chastened
And lost life's very bloom, in truth.
And loved you with a girlish hunger;
And love's sweet crown of jubilations.
And lures us to the tree of mystery:
And maddened pangs of love's refrain.
And made me thine for evermore! 
And makes no effort to astound
And make them magic songs anew.
And malice rules a petty mind?
And managed somehow to remain.
And managed to dispel her trance;
And man of honour, nothing less:
And many more. But her confusion
And, maybe, secret apprehension
And may his dear old bones be blest
And meantime I've just now completed
And meantime, feigning resignation,
And mediocrity alone
And merely as an idle scheme,
And mid the hum and hush of life,
And mileposts soothe the idle eye
And millions of our fellow creatures
And mind the beauty of his nails.
And missed the room she'd always had.
And modern man himself portrayed
And more than once, in cotton cap,
And mornings read some book right through. . . .
And mortgaged all the land he could.
And mourned his ashes with a sigh.
And mourn him yet. . . . But wherefore mourn?
And my Zaretsky, as I've said,
And my first cousin, good Buynov,*
And nameless pangs and sweet perdition . . .
And nature seemed to wait and wait
And nature's made of wayward stuff
And 'neath it: toute vous Annette; 
And 'neath the misty moon on high
And 'neath the spreading willow tree
And neither distance, nor the chain
And never asked if she agreed.
And no one's ears were shocked a bit
And nothing grand or more refined.
And nothing issued from his quill;
And noting how poor Tanya shook,
And novels set her heart aglow;
And now I seize the first occasion
And now, alas! . . . she lives attended
And now along Tverskya Street
And now another tries to trip her,
And now at last the wait has ended;
And now from nearby quarters, brothers,
And now he's at the porch at last;
And now his gazing eye discovers
And now it's time, indeed long past,
And now, malignant in intention,
And now, my friends, I hear once more
And now she feels her kerchief go,
And now she leaps! And now she whirls!
And now they trundle Tanya daily
And now with solemn mien, and dying
And now with what great concentration
And nursing noble passion's rages,
And o'er the lacquered boards we glide.
And of a friendly glass or two
And off runs glutton youth to capture
And off the guests would drive, well fed.
And oftentimes she'd sit all day
And, oh, how base to pamper grossly
And, oh, how many jests and rhymes,
And on arrival duly meet
And on a rumpled sofa lay
And once inside that silent study,
And once, when riding battle station,
And on her covered table serves
And on her lips a slender smile.
And on her shoulder rests his head. . . .
And only nanny might have guessed,
And on my heart retain their hold.
And on the leaves of recollection,
And on the road . . . grown lean and fearless,
And on the snow make rainbows glitter.
And on the spice of malice thriving,
And on the whole despised mankind,
And on those pages everywhere
And our Katnin gave us there
And over all that dusty crowd
And over wine she sang for guests;
And pain has made us humble men
And paler than the moon at dawn,
And pass him medicines morosely
And picture truly with my pen
And play but chords; or turning gently
And playfully astound the young,
And pledge of life beyond this earth!
And ploughs a trail of fluffy furrows;
And plunging into deep despond,
And poet filled with Kantian truth.
And pondered my Zarma's* fate? . . .
And, presently, induced a snore;
And propped upon an elbow, writing,
And proved unfaithful to her grief.
And purely to delight and pamper,
And pushes slightly on the door. . . .
And quickly blamed him, heaven knows!
And quite contented with his fate,
And quite devoid of affectations;
And quite forgot. Its pathway now
And racks where modish rhymesters wilt,
And rather glad he was, it's true,
And raven locks of shoulder reach.
And read my Apuleius keenly,
And read the books he'd called his own.
And read the future by the moon.
'And really you prefer the other?'
And recollect a time that's gone?
And reverently I guard it still;
And rightly so: in inquisition,
And round Eugene there soon collected
And rushed to greet her rhyming love
And said a prayer to soothe my plight?
And sang of childhood effervescent,
And sang the Salghir captives' praises.*
And, scarce alive, cried out goodbye.
And scorning then Apollo's ire
And sealed the solemn compact fast,
And seen in all. . . Onegin's face.
And sees the grave before it yawn,
And sees the truth: she loves him yet! 
And send these fruits of inspiration
And set beside the poet's glass.
And sets its sails for far and near;
And settled down and grew contented.
And several maidens, far from gay
And shall I then in silence yawn
And she, as if by fire seared,
And she from whom I drew, impassioned,
And she my willing lips will teach
And she was not the sort who glories
And she, whose beauty I admire
And ships to us by Baltic seas
And showed poor Tanya when he freed her
And show you how he spent each day.
And sighed, recalling their interment.
And, sighing, started home for bed;
And silently he hung his head.
And silently his pistol drops.
And since I dried your baby tears!'
'And since I pulled you by the ears!'
And since each rule permits exceptions,
'And since my gingerbread surprised you!'
And sings of Volga fishers, plaiting
And sit for hours seeing naught,
And sleeps beside her through the night.
And slowly day begins its flight.
And slurp from salty shells those bites
And smothered yawns with brittle laughter:
And snorts in fear, the traveller shivers
And so Eugene learned all about
And so I lived in old Odessa . . .
And so? Inebriated lover,
And so I offer, worthy spouses,
And so, by countryside tradition,
And so, dear reader, grant me pause
And so decayed, until he duly
And so estranged these former friends?
And so, far off in thought she wandered:
And so, for all his fiery mettle,
And so, for once, Eugene elected
And softly dim her gentle eyes.
And soft seductive nights as well.
And so he killed eight years of youth
And so in secret she requested
And so, in slow but growing fashion
And so let's hasten to the walk
And so let's part; farewell. . . adieu!
And so, life's afternoon has started,
And some few novels done with power,
And some of Venus, some of Piles.
And some old manwhen he espied her
And sometimes he himself got bled
And sometimes in the evening hours
And somewhat pale, too thin and small,
And soon a great discovery brought her
And soon, quite soon, the tempest's core
And soon the fragrant tea was flowing
And soon the general verdict ran,
And soon the open doorway beckoned.
And soon the square grows gay and vital.
And soon with ringing slabs of slate
And so our maiden fully tasted
And so, scarce breathing, down she hastened
And so she turned for love's discussion
And so the friends departed
And so the prince led up to greet her
And so they metlike wave with mountain,
'And so they took me off to strangers ...
And sought in vain to catch her eye;
And so was not in any measure
And so you're off. . . forgive me then.
And so your mistress (faithful minion)
And sparkles dance before her eyes.
And sparkling Southern sun dispenses
And sparkling in the sunlight's shimmer,
And spleen, he saw, would dog his life,
And starts to sing, off-key. Loud cheering
And steer for now a new direction,
And steps inside. The crush increases,
And sterner cares now seek admission;
And still consumes enough for two.
And stirs in me, I won't conceal,
And stoves of tile in many shades.
And straightway too, to all her kin
And strength of mind were working still,
And strikes his chair against the floor;
And strip the forest bare all round.
And stuff him with the play I wrote;
And summon forth a sombre bliss,
And sure enough a note came flying;
And talk all day once they begin.
And tears asunder winter's chains;
And tears her golden earrings out;
And tell him that he's not to mention
And thanks the Lord for ruts and mire
And their dull means to festive ends.
And the majestic, antlered cuckold
And then Eugene approached and spoke:
And then I'll write this world a song
And then Monsieur took on the child,
And then a sudden thought came gleaming:
And then at home all day he stays,
And then at thirty, married well,
And then await sweet recompense.
And then by post Eugene was speeding,
And then, good God, she starts to bawl:
And then he'd dress. . . .
And then her warm imagination
And then he saw that country byways
And then he soared, his soul alight
And then in private he'd prepare
And then in silence meditated
And then maintain the shameless fiction
And then, mid trees, a hut emerges;
And then postponed till they could get
And then the bent-head oxen pant
And then the dream came true for me!
And then the guest would be invited
And then their waltzing is repeated!
And then the other slowly twirls,
And then there's Southern sun and ocean . . .
And then they ask, in compensation
And then upon the end of play,
And then waxed voluble once more
And then with doubt in fullest measure
And then with verse of quickened sadness
And there . .. ethereal. .. resplendent,
And there, my glowing pipe ignited,
And there's Mashk,* all green-encased,
And there the Muse spread out for me
And there the caustic Shakhovsky
And there the crush, the glare, the heat,
And there the nightingale, spring's lover,
And there the ploughman rests at will
And there where Tartar tongues are spoke
And there where now his ashes lie
And there, where southern waves break high,
And these suggest a spa or two.
And they prevailed. Her lips more steady,
And think at my untimely grave:
And though I grieve, I weep no more;
And, though immune to reading's charm,
And thought: What foolishness to wreck
And though, thank God, he never acted
And though the language of my friend
And though we're loath to cast aspersions,
And thus more surely we undo her
And thus preserved by fate's decree,
And thus they aged, as do all mortals.
And time would pass, till Olga'd brew
And to each mad and fevered rout
And to her doll, without demur,
And took at last to coming down
And to our rhyming guild calls down:
And to their passions ever cold.
And to the opera we must get,
And trail the seemly crowd's procession
And treads on toes to reach his seat;
And trembles like a hunted fawn.
And tried to write. But art's exaction
And truffles, youth's delight so keen,
And turned coquette! A fickle toddler!
And uncurbed passions ruled the day.
And under heels parquet would crack;
And use a furtive ear to spy.
And used to say: "Oh grant me, life,
And verses will be common duties.
And vibrant life in taking root
And visited the humble tents
And waits impatient in her clearing
And waits impatiently to hear.
And wakes her nurse to share her plight.
And wakes to find her room alight,
And walked the boy in Letny Park.*
And wallow, friends, both you and I!
And wanders through those woods all day.'
And was it not in past enjoyment
And was it you I heard replying
And watched a different world unfold.
And wears that same tulle bonnet yet;
And we as well shall face that hour
And weeping, they undid my plait,
And we now press our wilful claim
And were deceived by it in turn;
And wet the metal bit with foam,
And what an awesome dream she's dreaming:
And what a soul! . . . Come visit, do!
And what does Fate prepare for me?'
And what ensued from that event;
And what of keen lorgnettes, I say ... ?
And what of other fascinations?
And what we called a fop, no less.
And what would be your own reaction
And when Eugene drew my attention,
And when across this world I pass
And when he found it necessary
And when he tried to speak at last,
And when he wished, he'd make appear
And when we wish it, always ready
And where are stormy love's desires,
And where are you, poetic fires,
And where has youth (glib rhyme) been banished?
And where my buried heart is kept.
And where's her sister now, poor lass?
And where that gloomy, strange betrayer,
And where the tearstains? . . . Not a trace!
And whether, pierced,
And while the 'honest chap' conferred
And while the horses, bored at tether,
And while the lamps both in and out
And while the people still are tapping,
And while the weary band of servants
And whiskers, tusks, and tufted tails,
And whisper to each other closely:
And, whistling, fires with a rush.
And whist, which reigns supreme today,
And who emerged when it was lifted?
And who'll be kind enough to measure
And why #62038; Lordhave I not felt
And why for gold it need not strive,
And why not let the poet rage!
And wind, the morning's herald, rushes,
And winter's joys in every shade.*
And with a heart that's warm and tender?
And with an elbow each one prodded
And with a smile the world caressed us;
And with a spirit never still,
And with a wistful sigh he muses:
And, with a yawn, took up his pen
(And with good cause!), he found it better
And with her wrinkled hand the nurse
And with its murky light defining
And with my wilful Muse let's hustle
And with one voice the grannies cry:
And with their usual sort of bluster,
And with the moon's celestial light
And with these words he drained his glass
And women reapers come to fill
And won't then be evaluated
And woods where once I used to roam!
And worked her way across the torrent
And yet I'll say on his behalf,
And yet, I think, I'd wish to claim
And yetalthough his eyes were reading,
And yet a trip in winter season
And yet her husband loved her dearly;
And yet he's stubborn . . . still resistant,
And yet the regal moon shines brighter
And yield my rights to love's translation. . . .
(And you, good reader, with your hunches,
And you, my sentimental pretties
And you, my true ideal, my own!
And you, my youthful inspiration,
And you, small book, my constant labour,
And youthful hopes on youthful wings.
(An edict that was meant, you see,
An elegy, to show he cared.
An empty phantom or a joke,
An endless bottle of champagne
An epigram of cunning spite
An episode too slight to mention,
A new persona has arrived:
An honest man who'd served sincerely,
An idle stillness rules the sky,
An inn at every stage en route.
Anisya came in just a second,
Announcing dawn and working time
Annoyed with leisure and inaction,
A noble heart and upright mind.
A noisy swarm, to meadow bloom.
A nook where pensive dryads played.
Another! No! In all creation 
Another ballroom king on station
Another bard in exaltation
Another captured her affection,
Another fruitless day went by.
Another memory finds me ready:
Another round would hardly hurt them,
Another's joy, another's pain,
Another squire chose this season
Another with his love's perfection
A novel in the older vein
Answers the drumbeat's duty call.
A pack of barking dogs chased round her;
A painful joy that lifts her gloom
A partial viewthe poet's curse.
A patterned vision spread before me.
A perfect love of righteous ways,
A perilous and shaky bridge;
A pistol, cocked and lifted high,
A pond for ducks to wallow free.
Apostate from the storms of passion,
Appears absurd or overbearing
Appear so proud or so forbearing,
'Approach at will!' Advancing coldly,
Approaches Olga . . . idly jests,
(A prize to make the French feel proud!).
A proper challenge or cartel: 
A quilted gown and cuckold's horn,
A quittent at a modest rate;
'Archival dandies'* in a cluster
Are Tasso's octaves' soaring flights.
Are always met with warm embraces,
Are babbled out and soon revealed.
Are empty. ... I'd as soon be trading
Are entered by each would-be friend
Are ever thus; with brow perplexed,
Are filled with girls in sleep's embrace.
A rending cry amid the strife
Are nothing more to us than tools . . . Since feelings are for freaks and fools.
Are out of fashion nowadays.
Are quite as faithless as their feet.
Are you my angel of salvation
Arises, ripens, and must fall;
Armenian, Spaniard, Frenchman sleek,
A rogue and gossip night and noon,
A roguish rhyme to tease the smitten.
Arose . . . and instantly withdrew.
Around each painted belle and dame.
Aroused in you some hint of kindness;
A roving pedlar one day brought
Arriving home together thus
A rumbling, black abyss did yawn. . ..
As Boston, ombre (old men's play),
'As God's my witness, dear, I promise.'
As I approached the farm . . . Enough!
As I from my Onegin do.
(As I in jest so oft pretended)?
As I must now admit, I see.
As Olga poured it, dark and glowing,
As Sadi* long before us said.
As Tanya's husband enters proudly
As all applaud, Onegin enters
As artless as the one you tendered;
As at a vexing separation,
As bitter losses we recall;
As clear as maiden thoughts, as candid
As cold and chaste as winter snow;
As comrades now. Whatever end
As dark forebodings filled her mind
As did derivative Knyazhnin;
As did the skeptical old fool,
As does a drunk in sleep's embraces,
As down the shortest road they fly;
A secret wreath that hung there swaying
A-seethe with plenty's wares and cries.
A serving boy took cream around.
As far as Lensky's wedding stood,
As fencelike they go flashing by.
As first I saw you rise before us,
As from the meadow your light trace.
As gay as morning's rosy dress,
Ashamed to see himself the clearer;
As heaven's galaxy shines down
As he descended to the grave.
As heeding passion's siren song
As if a chilling hand had pressed
As if encased in armoured plate.
As if in terror I had read
As if it were some funeral feast;
As if they all thought her to blame.
As if today, through some restriction,
(A simile in many ways);
A simple Russian family throng;
A simple and affecting tune,
A simple but a nice old lady;
A simple stone adjoins the brook.
As in a dreadful senseless dream,
As in a misty dream at night,
As infant slumber, as the moon
A single feeling in his breast;
As in some dull, Van Dyck madonna;
Asked Tanya .. . and the children leapt
Asked Tanya's mother, full of cheer;
A slave of God and Brigadier
Asleep till morn beneath her pillow;
As love's high art. . . and was applauded
As men today no longer do;
As mouths start chewing.
As n in French .. . and through the nose;
(As once some poet drew himselP).
As one whom love had left forsaken,
As only poets, mad with passion,
As others tell of passions swelling;
As people say without translation,
As phantom daydreams haunt your mind:
A spirit strange but full of fire,
Assailed by doubts, she grew dejected:
Assails her heart, he brings her light,
Assault the senses all at once.
As sentiments to be derided,
As she embraced her younger daughter
Assigned their roomsfrom entrance hall
As storms refresh the fields of spring.
As sweet and trusting children do.
As sweet as love's own soft caress;
A stable, fence, and kitchen shed.
A standing deer with horns held low,
A stately general at her heels.
As tears well up to dim her eyes.
As through a mist of stifled tears. . . .
As through the dust by post he flew,
A story rich in feelings too,
A stranger who had wandered in.
A stream of elegies then flows.
A stream that bubbles, foams, and hisses.
A substitute for joy I'd find.
A sudden clink of spurs rings loudly,
A sudden faintness comes upon her,
As vulgar. (I won't even try
A swarm of dreams, both sad and tender,
A swarm of thoughts with every word;
(As was the casefor nothing passes
As were the arts of social dealing;
As with old friends, she keeps returning
As yet unmarked by disillusion
As yet unseen, and yet so dear,
As you, Saint-Priest,* have demonstrated
As you, great Homer, you whose song
(As you, of course, well know the chap);
As your dear waist, my sweet Zizi,*
At Madame Larin's country seat
At Shrovetide feasts their table flourished
At Trinity, when service brings
A tale of lovers and their lot,
At dusk or entre chien et loup*
A tempting riddle of confusions;
A tender dream that she someday
A tender novel with that name.*
At everything around the room;
At every turn he seems to find her,
At fifty shed all obligation
At first Madame was in attendance;
At first disturbed me, in the end
At first he'd beg a declaration,
At first she didn't wish to read,
At first their differences of heart
At first the neighbours' calls were steady;
At forty he'd have had the gout,
At green-baize tables players settle,
At home receives him without tension;
At home the poet, seething, paces
A thousand walks in evening's calm
A throng of nymphs her guardian band,
A tiny window glitters brightly,
At last he's ready for the world!
At least one note to linger long,
At least three hours he peruses
At masquerade or midnight ball.
'At my insistence.' Behind the mill, without a word.
A tombstone tells the passer-by:
Atop a lean and shaggy trotter
Atop the stove to wash and purr,
A traveller home from distant faring,
A truer love you'll never find.
A trusting soul in callous fashion.
At such an age, in such a year.
At talk were even less profound.
Attempt to ford the muddy street.
At tender love's still timid passion;
Attends their giddy conversation
At the beginning of my story
At thirty steps with fine precision,
At this unwanted revelation.
At times attentive, then uncaring!
At times he reads her works of fiction
At times the fresh and youthful kisses
A twinge at least of some bursitis?
Aurora Leads forth from morning dales the sun*
Ausonia's * happy sons are humming
A valley-lily come to flower
A vast neglected garden made
A verse to warn that Tanya tarried,
A victim draped in lavish veil. . . .
A voice proclaim: 'Well then, he's dead!'
Avoiding further explanation,
A waddling red-foot goose now scurries
Awaited here, in vain, surrender
Awakened early none the less,
Aware of snow, his nag is fearful,
A warmth in you quite unexpected,
A waxing crescent moon on high,
A way to calm her troubled mind.
A wild creature, sad and pensive,
A windmill there was squat-jig dancing
A word of candid explanation.
A word of warning should suffice.
A worthy object! Never mind,
A youthful friend for some infraction:
Bacchante-like, at all our revels,
'Back thenfar off from vain commotion,
Back then it seemed that I required
Back to our springtime's golden morn.
Bakhchisarai,* you fount of splendour!
Baratynsky
Bard of The Feasts* and languid sorrow,
Base cowards, slanderers full-blown,
Bassoon and flute announce the band.
Became in time our young man's fate,
Because an ardent spirit's daring
Because in tripe the solemn find
Because she heeds the call of passion
Because she's trusting more than proud,
Because the dull are cramped by wit?
Because we take mere talk for action,
Become good friends from sheer ennui.
Bedbugs and fleas at every station
Bedecked in broad-brimmed Bolivar,* 
Bedraped in dresses long outmoded;
Been foolish when I failed to wait;
Been weak at Russian conversation?
Before a mansion's double gate.
Before him faces come and go
Before his darling Olga's face,
Before his gaze. And these alone
Before no critic will he grovel,
Before that gaze so openhearted,
Before that soft and simple trust,
Before that soul so bright and just!
Before the dull and frigid crowd;
Before the fronts of darkened houses,
Before the hearth the table's laid.
Before the hostess in succession,
Before their hands are stained with crime?
Before their loyal subjects' gaze,
Before them now a forest slumbers;
Before the raging gulf ahead.
Before the star's disintegration,
Before the window on the bed,
Begins to fade. The vale emerges
Begins to trace with lovely fingers
Beheld outdoors a wondrous sight:
Behind a nearby stump Guillot
Behind her back she hears the bear,
Behind his silent study door,
Behind the hill the moon's a sliver;
Behold you at our country place, 
Be kind and send my doubts away;
Believed in dreams and card prediction,
Believe me (conscience be your token):
Believe me, you 'd have never learned 
Believes the chosen dream she's painted
Beloved friend, sweet friend, I wait,
Bemoans her worthless mate, deserted
Bemused and muddled, his own rook.
Beneath a shady park's protection
Beneath a verse left incomplete,
Beneath her parents' loving gaze,
Beneath it sings as in the past
Beneath my Africa's warm sky,*
Beneath the gleam of lamps and stars.
Beneath the lines from other hands,
Beneath the moonbeams' silver light
Beneath the moon's seductive ray.
Beneath them quiet streamlets wind,
Beneath the skies of distant lands,
Beneath the table barely seen,
Beneath the waves, while older men
Beneath this stone now resteth here.
Beneath two pine trees, old for ages.
Beset with yearning and with rhyme
Beshtu,* the watchman of the waste;
Beside a limpid flowing brook,
Beside a short-tailed dwarf. . . and that
Beside a spot where lindens grow.
Beside the Spanish envoy, pray .. .
Beside the couple's coach below,
Beside the door stood tightly laced,
Beside the road the sunlight glinted.
Beside the tender maiden's bed,
Be thinking of... or merely feeling,
Betrayals, gossip, rings, and tears,
Betrayed, was always glad to rest.
Between the meat and blancmanger,
Between the printed lines lay hidden
Between two aunts, beside a column,
Betwixt her chores and idle hours
Bewitched by moonlight's magic curse. . .
Beyond this great divide at last,
Blending the plain and idealistic
Blind fortune's malice and men's scorn.
Bokhrins, sleighs, apothecaries,
Born of my green and withered years . . .
Both friends and foes had come ahustling,
Both honour and a manly pride.
Both love's and Petrarch's ardent speech.
Both others' and their own successes,
Both river and the shores that flank it.
Both wit and brains were out of place,
'Bout evil ghosts and girls like you;
Breaks out in mournful serenading.
Breeds ducks and geese, and oversees
Brief passages from Nordic lays;
Bright youth divines, not knowing sadness,
Bring out your own or rent a horse,
Brought up in Oriental splendour,
Burns even stronger than before,
But God, what deadly boredom, brothers,
But Hymen's cares and tribulations,
But I am now another's wife,
But I can't blame you or forget
But I have no intent of waging
But I, in love, was dense and mute.
But I'll be mute. I don't propose
But I'll present you now with joy.'
'But I'm not made for exaltation:
But I my fancy's fruits and flowers
But I prefer above these others
But I've no wish to change a line;
But I've no wish to praise you now;
'But I've so little income, father.'
But I was born for peaceful roaming,
But Lensky, having no desire
But Moscow never bent her knees,
But Olga didn't read the things.
But Tanya found she couldn't cry;
But Tanya, in a kind of trance,
But Tanya's heart is far from captured:
But all at once for good withdrew
But all seems joyless, bleak and dark;
But all that foamy, frothy wheezing
But all that shows in her dark glass
But all the while, as Tanya pondered,
But all they ever seem to mention
But all too soon our paths divided,
(But aren't they one, if they offend us?)
But as the rural dusk encroaches,
But blest is he who rightly gauges
But by the third he couldn't stick it:
But called for strict and full compliance
But can one justly, friends of mine,
But can't you, friends, forgive her, pray,
But cherishing your friendship's claim,
But dare not bother with my lyre
'But death from him is sweet compassion.
But dinner's served. And so by pairs,
But disenchanted just as quick,
But dolls were never Tanya's passion,
But enmity among their class
But even Nina, shining forth
But even friendships like our heroes
But finally she rose, forsaken,
But first in dazzling hope you nourish
But fit for apes, who once held sway
But flaming youth in all its madness
But fools will whisper . . . grin . . . and crow! . . .'
But forward, forward, #62038; my story!
But found it noxious in the north.*
But from our friends, dear God, defend us!
But from that band I soon departed
But generally, you'll have to grant,
But give me first a pen and paper;
But hardly had she turned and taken
But having read Tatyana's letter,
But he departs, his hopes in tatters,
But he refused to go. He's ready
But here let's honour with affection
But here, your trip has left you haggard;
But her old wits were slow at best.
But he was wrong; that idle sinner
But how is one, in this dull season,
But hush! A strident critic rises
But if indeed I overborrow,
But if my hapless situation 
But if you knew the anguish in it:
But in small town and countryside
But journeys too, like all the rest,
But just for show, as if to spite
But knew by heart a fine collection
But lead them to the altar then.
But lest too soon I join the dead, 
But let it be. Take this collection
But let it be: it's now too late 
But let's abandon idle chatter
But let us then as friends be parted,
But listen as our friends speak low:
But lit instead a conflagration.
But look, Onegin's at the gateway;
But look, the crowd's astir and humming;
But lo! . . . with crimson hand
But madrigals they'll have you write!
But man of honour and of sense.
But meanwhile, dressed for morning pleasure,
But mine must be a brother's role.
But moist Odessa, all too sadly,
But mother with her lamentation
But my Eugene all evening heeded
But my poor Lensky, deep at heart,
But neither did her form contain,
But neither whist, nor gossip there,
But never would he lead astray
But no! Each moment of my days
But no one hears his neighbour out;
But no one knew her inclination
But no, she can't. What explanation? . . .
But not at all: as blithe as ever,
But not a trite or vulgar word,
But no! the deal fell through again.'
But not the timid maid who'd pleaded,
But not today. Although I cherish
But now, #62038; Muse, forget the past!
But now Didelot is boring stuff.'
But now! . . . What unbecoming schemes
But nowadays I'm not so canny,
But now a kind and simple soul
But now, as in a house deserted,
But now at last his doubts were gone:
But now blue evening starts to darken,
But now her door is softly swinging:
But now he slowly wakes at last,
But now it's changed: we're all like ladies;
But now it's late. Odessa's dreaming;
But now it's late. The winds are blowing,
But now it's late and time for leaving.
But now it's over. Supper's heeded.
But now our minds have grown inactive,
But now the chime and watch alert them:
But now the hammer's smashing boulders,
But now the monument stands dreary
But now the moonbeams' glowing light
But now the shades of night grow thinner,
But now the sun climbs heaven steeply,
But now they're near. Before them, gleaming,
But once a weekI'd see your face, 
But once you've had your fatal fun,
But one glance back. Farewell, you bowers,
But one long string of dreary scenes
But one persistent thought the while.
But only one bright image holds him,
But on the whole, not bad at all;
But other days bring other dreams;
But pantaloons, gilet, and frock
But pensiveness, her friend and treasure
But pleased to have their duty done,
But quickly summer seems to fly,
But reading Adam Smith restored him,
But read no Cicero at all
But recently this winter stayed,
But roads are bad now in our nation;
But round it boredom seems to hover;
But see . . . Oh, nanny, don't refuse!'
But shambles somehow down the way.
But she ignores her sister's pleading,
But shows a simple, quiet air.
But shy and frightened, does not dare
But simply tell as best I may
But sleep had hardly come to take him
But somehow just the look he gave
But sometimes there are certain pages
But soon her thirsting spirit savoured
But soon she dropped her city pose:
But soon the guests are somewhat sated;
But speaks of him. She cannot bear
But spiteful people saw no beauty
But still Onegin lies within
' But still her anguished heart embraces
But still her heart in panic rushes,
But still, in books he saw no harm,
But still, we welcome you with feeling.
But stop .. . Enough! My babbling lyre
But suddenly a snowbank shifted,
But surely, Your honour's all the pledge 
But sweeter still, amid such nights,
'But, sweetheart, I've grown old ... I mean . . .
But, taking leave, requests permission
But tea is brought: the girls demurely
But tell me Lensky, how and when
'But tell me, Prince, you wouldn't know
'But tell me, what's your friend been doing?'
'But tell me, which one was Tatyana?'
But thank the Lord, you seem more steady;
But that pretentious game is dated,
But that's enough. I must make haste
But that will do. My beauty's letter
But then as torpor dulled sensation,
But then at last, as it was dawning,
But then, by empty dreams deflected,
But then her course abruptly veered,
But then sheer terror seized Tatyana ...
But then she took to keeping house
But then their charming wives he found
But then their friendship grew, and soon
But then they led her to the altar
But there beneath the Finnish sky,
But there, enough; have done at last:
But this cool princess so resplendent,
But those on whom the Muse has acted
But those to whom, as friends and brothers,
But thou, fair maiden, wilt thou come!
But though it's won no favour yet, '
But thrifty neighbours waxed indignant
But to the young its raptures bring
But was he happy in the flower
But wearied by the ballroom's clamour,
But we have lots of neighbours call,
But we must grant, though it offend us:
But we must say that he was granted
But we, we band of callow joysters,
But what care I for all they do?
But what did I, amazed, discover?
But what did I then find in you?
But what ensued from Tanya's meeting?
But what of my Eugene?
But what of our Eugene this while?
But what's the point? I'd like to know it.
But what was Tanya's stunned reaction
But when Eugene's felicitations
'But when did fate cast him our way?
But when he reached his uncle's haven,
But when the age of restless turnings
But when the years have made us older,
But when they learned that in the rear
But where, God knows. All trace is dead.
But where Melpomene still stages
But where are all your evenings spent?'
But where he now no longer reigns . . .
But where his genius proved unfailing,
But where in such a headlong rush
But where's distress? Commiseration?
But where's my rambling story rushing?
. . But where's our lady all this while?)
But where such madrigals and roses
But which today I use no more.
But who is that among the chosen,
But whom to love? To trust and treasure?
' 'But who's it for, my little bird?
But why on earth does he inspire
But why succumb to grim emotion?
But will he come? .. . She doesn't hear him.
But wretched he who's too far-sighted,
But you, Bordeaux, I find just right;
But you, odd tomes of haughty ladies,
But you, perhaps, are not attracted
But you're not even listening, pet.'
But you've gone pale again, my child!'
But you, you men in wedded bliss,
Buynov tried: she turned him down.
Buynov whirls off Pustyakva;
By Baratynsky's penI vow:
By Lensky's brief, ill-fated days.
By Olga's winning, youthful charms,
By Tolstoy's* magic brush, and scented
By afternoon he'll finally waken,
By all the flow of lively wit.
By ancient lindens near the brook,
By being at this feast he hated,
By bringing dreams before her gaze.
By briny waves refreshed and righted,
By candlelight she'd rise and dress.
By chance those verses haven't vanished;
By children and by faithful wife
By clumps of snow; and through the summits
By dreams of him; each passing hour
By ending his proud days a martyr
By everyone. Eugene has fled
By falling gravely ill, he's won
By fate's mysterious dispensation,
By feelings and perturbed no more,
By filling them with song instead
By fingers that are learning still.
By gardens, mansions, fashion shops;
By his pretentious, studied bearing:
By joining him at least in grieving,
By lonely fields and burbling brook,
By making his the thoughts of others
By mighty Zeus's will elected
By pictures of this simple kind,
By rank in turn as each deserved.*
Byron
(By scientific computation,
By seeming in their words at least
By sentry booths and peasant lasses;
By shaded cliff a camel lying,
By shooting at his pallid face
By snowy blizzards buried deep.
By supper's call. We country sinners
By sylvan shade that lay implanted
By thoughts of fame and freedom smitten,
By thoughts of love, by dreams of joy.
By turns Tatyana groans and sighs.
By tyrant-fashion's high decrees,
Called him a menace and a freak.
Called up a face from long ago.
Call out for men to try their mettle:
Calls out his name!No earthly power
Calls up the life she left behind
Came close to grasping at that time
Came due in turn, the girl's dismay,
Came in and took the window chair.'
Came rushing quickly to surround her.
Can Fate indeed be so unkind?
Can be excused his rash intentions.
Can bring him back: the singer's gone,
'Can it be true?' Eugene reflected.
Can it be true, its bloom has passed,
Can it be true, my heyday's ended
Can one not love our native Moscow?
Can she have found the final clue?
Can she have solved the riddle's power?
Can still produce a lovely flutter
Can tell the time without great fuss:
Can that be he? It is, I say.
'Can that be she? ... It seems . . . and yet. . .
Can this be real? Scarce more than swaddler
Can't see her fields and valleys glisten:
Can you, so strong of mind and heart,
Capricious belles of lofty station!
Caricatures of those he saw.
Casts only spleen and languid sadness
Catching the scent, the road horse quivers

Compendium of affectation,
Conceal his hopes, play jealous swain,
Concealing her wrought-up condition,
Concerning Olga, that he'll mention;
Confused with tender shame the while
Constrained to curtsey . . . almost reels.
Consumed by bitter meditation,
Consumed with jealous indignation,
Contented with the life I led.
Contests obscenely our estate.
Convinced that Olga's heart was cruel,
Coquettes would leave their ageing smiles
Corneille's full genius resurrected;
Corrupt her youthful heart with lies,
Cosmopolite? A Slavophile?
Could alter Lensky's deep desire,
Could answer keenly, be obtuse,
Could barely make her meaning clear;
Could dream both day and night again 
Could find no purpose for his life.
Could get two friends prepared to fight,
Could gull a fool, and had an eye
Could not conceive how solemn Grimm*
Could not eclipse her neighbour's light.
Could say a word to you; and then, 
Coursed on and never ceased to press
Crackling the freshly fallen snow;
Creates a passage with his sleigh;
Creeps to the door and, softly peering,
Cries out from sleep Encore!and then
Crisp days when sunlit hoarfrost glimmers,
Curl out of sight; the hearth exhales
Curse masters and beat palms together;
Cut down by fate at break of dawn!
Dame Larin muttered with a moan.
Dame Larin's eyes began to water
Damns poetry for interfering
Dared clean his nails in front of him, 
Darlings, then, let's scamper off, 
Dealt out her motley faro pack.
Dear Lord have mercy. God, I plead!
Dearest hearts and darling friends, 
Deceitful vice was made to pay
Dedication*
Deemed it a minor peccadillo;
Dense brush abounds; on every hand
Departure day was long expected;
Description, though, is my profession;
Desires, dreams, and sorrows pleading
Despite herself she wondered too;
Devises to attract the sight,
Devoid of any spark of feeling
Diana's breast is charming, brothers,
Diana's visagerecollecting
Did I not see your apparition
Didelot his crown of fame perfected.*
Did he, sad bard, awake protesting
Diminished, lengthened, turned on end.
Disarmed youth's heart... or tried at least.
Discuss a Say or Bentham*ever;
Disjointed dreamsobscure and vast;
Dispatching chaps just anyhow,
Dissolved amid the balmy air;
Distorted readings, noise, and blame!
Distorted sweetly all the rules
Disturbed her soul and caused her pain,
Disturbed the slumber that he sought.
Dmitriev
Does Olga's Lensky thus compose;
Does not withdraw impassive fingers
Does spring awake the buried seed.
Don't lower your lorgnettes at night!
Down to the stream below the knoll.
Do you find him more pleasing, pray,
Do you now clothe in sacred dress?'
Do you today devote your song?
Draws back the curtains and his covers,
Drew back and stopped when he appeared. . . .
Drew forth his flute's first ardent moan.
Drops in for whist and joins routinely;
Drunk as a pig, and suffered capture
Du comme il faut. . . (Shishkov,* be kind:
EUGENE ONEGIN
EXCERPTS FROM ONEGIN'S JOURNEY
Each day he rides to take his station
Each day is dear, each moment too!
Each has his own preoccupation,
Each morning early I'm awake
Each morning through the park and grounds.
Each moves his setting, shifts his chair,
Each pair a blur in quick succession,
Each pane a fragile pattern showing;
Each passing hour more captivated
Each to his own, or so they say.
Each with a different dogma girded;
Each year they promised, as before,
Eight rubbers; and eight times as well
Elated by the music's bouncing,
Elle tait fille, elle tait amoureuse.*
Emits a yawn and snores again.
Enchanted land! There for a season,
Enchanted with each passing pleasure,
Enchanting creatures that entreat
Enchanting, yet so fraught with trouble?
(Encouraged, though, by Olga's smile),
Endowed with bright perfection's glow.
Enlightenment has failed to mend us,
* * * Ennui! . . .
Enough! Clear-souled and far from wasted,
Enough! The burden's off my shoulder!
Enough; get up. To you I owe
Enough now! Sing of something more!'
Enough, old boy, my ears are ringing!
Enrich the slumbering heart's dull load,
Entreaties, vows, pretended fears,
Escape unscathed ... the slippery devil!
E sempre bene, gentlemen.
Especially since the local wine
Estranged from men and discontented,
Eugene alone could see his worth;
Eugene and I had both decided
Eugene and he recalled the jesting,
Eugene, detesting litigation
Eugene devised a few concessions
Eugene fell down before her, kneeling;
Eugene had kept his silent air;
Eugene, in sudden chill, despairs,
Eugene, of course, had keen perceptions
Eugene, once left to contemplation
Eugene stared down at Lensky, shaken.
Eugene stood lost in pensive dreaming
Eugene throws wide the door, revealing
Eugene (to speak of him again),
Eugene, who'd fled their wild abuses,
Eugene, who loved the youth at heart,
Eugene, with friendly condescension,
Eugene, with secret malice grinning,
Eugene would hear his views intently
Evoked his pity more than anger:
Evokes some pity for my woe, 
Exalted, tender, boldly wrought?
Examine her from head to toe.
Except of course ourselves alone.
Except the sea's incessant sound.
Except to charm her thirsting soul.
' Exist no more; for we've outgrown
Expecting he would soon appear.
Expect the rhyme, so take itRose!)
Express himself and even write;
Express not pain, but death's intrusion.
Extinguished ashes won't rekindle,
Exulting in anticipation,
Eye Tanya with a priggish frown,
F
Fair crystal of my soul and key
Fair summer's days and careless treasures,
Falls silent fast. Alone the chorus
Falls silent in anticipation.
Fare thee well, and if for ever, Still for ever, fare thee well.
Farewell, #62038; golden games' illusion!
Farewell, celestial beauty's home,
Farewell, fond nature, where I flourished!
Farewell, my freedom, deeply cherished!
'Farewell, my peaceful home and fate!
'Farewell, my peaceful vales and fountains!
Farewell now, scene of fame unsteady,
Farewell, secluded place of hiding!
Farewell, you too, familiar mountains
Farewell, you too, my moody neighbour,
Far from the Rome his heart embraced.
Far more than some who part this life.
Far off Tatyana ranged in dreaming,
Fat Pustyakv, the local charmer,
Fate watched Eugene in his dependence;
(Faublas'* disciple and his tool),
Feel frightened tooso let it go,
Felt all his old ennui awaken,
Felt far from happy with his role.
Filled with his heart's regrets, and leaning
Finds even joy at times excessive,
Fine china, bronzesall displayed;
Fir, forest, hedgehog, night, and snow,
First floated dimly into sight
First off, he'd been at fault last night
Five paces more, while Lensky waited
Five versts or so from Krasnogory,
Flit softly through this lucent night?
Fly to the Neva's water then,
For I have known too well the witless
For I'm not worthy of them all.
For Mother Winter's happy pranks.
For Richardson was simply mad.
For Satan treats all love as play.
For after all he couldn't drain
For all lies veiled in misty dust.
For all the cares of love again?
For all those haunts that I once knew . . .
For all to see, or on the sly;
For all your gifts and all your joys;
For argument or food for thought:
For books had vanished, as we know,
For but one moment held temptation
For country calm and lack of strife;
For country freedom too possesses
For custom's rule o'er man prevails.
'For dreams and youth there's no returning;
Forebodings filled and pressed her heart.
For empty glitter, fuss, and noise!
Foretells a death to come ere long,
Forever hounded and reviled
Forever modest, meek in bearing,
Forever parted from her side.
For every social admonition;
For fashions change, and views will vary,
For fate took matters into hand.
For few will understand you so,
For fleeting fame I do not weep.
For fooling clever men completely,
For forty years had heaved his sighs,
For fun, for dreaming, for the heart. . .
Forgetting, then, the city's splendour,
Forgive me, but it's true, you know,
Forgotten in his wretched dwelling,
For hair and teeth and fingernail.
For hearty talk at evenfall,
For he'd become so fully jaded,
For her confessions of romance.
For him enchantment's deep infection
For its sake once, I squandered gladly
For jibes .. . and all his foul dominion.
For just my books, the simple joys
For just one day seek youth again.
For kneeling Moscow's hand to tender
For loathesomeness of soula clown,
For long enough. Congratulation
For long . . . forever. In his train
Forlorn and drifting snowbanks stand;
For love offends these charming ladies.
For luxury, for modish pleasure
For marriage bonds or wedding bell,
For me to struggle at this hour; 
For my poor hero, we'll adjourn
For my sad lot its share of splendour
For naturefond of contradictions
For nowadays in our great nation,
For now they'll seek accommodation
For one may be a man of reason
For other, colder dreams I nurse,
For otherwise, grown bored with pleasure,
For otherwise some mocking reader
For pain and grief as well as pleasures,
For placid comfortand to last;
For private and for other debts;
For raising journalistic clamour,
For rhyme, saw fit to resurrect it
For rooting in the ancient dust
For rural cunning isn't dead!):
For scrutiny no less irate.
For several days she couldn't find
For several minutes in succession
For she, in spite of family feeling,
For she was bored by all their noise,
For six whole weeks it happens yearly,
For starters (tell me if I'm wrong),
For storms and feasts and worldly noise,
For strange and simple tongues instead
For that small churchyard's shaded bowers,
For their sweet flow of revelation,
For there, at heart, I feel persuaded
For this delicious epithet;
For this may all be mere illusion,
For this your ardent spirit pined
For thus our giddy race gains power:
For trumpeting its happy lot
For two full days he was enchanted
For two full hours; then, quite late
For two whole weeks to see my kin,
For which no spring will come, in truth?
For which of them the grave lay waiting!
For whom, Tatyana, is it meant?
For whom but darkness lies ahead?
'For whom these sighs your lyre raises?
For winter. Then, in January,
For your sake smothered all my dreams
Four fateful steps. The space decreasing,
Four years consumptive, sad to note.
From Goethe's and from Schiller's hands.
From Gottingen with soulful yearning,
From Istanbul, the seaside's wares.
From all that I had ever cherished
From avid lips that press them so.
From bathhouse roof to wash, enraptured,
From bed to icy bath he wanders,
From boxes rising row on row.
From cellar store has just now come
From dream to dream a passage brief;
From early youth she read romances,
From eighteen-eight with tattered pages;
From every Moscow fop and Circe!
From frontside, backside, in between.
From head to toe, the slightest strain
From here he watched, immersed in thought,
From jealous critics fearing trouble,
From misty Germany our squire
From old Anisya. Next day then,
From pangs of jealous agitation;
From porch to yard, to garden straight;
From shipboard looming into sight,
From some quite gentlemanly distance.
From those backwoods!' And he directed
From two to thirty at the top;
From walls ancestral portraits glowered;
From where the smug and worthless sit?
Galop, mazurka, waltz. . . . And there,
Gay magpies on the lawn outside,
Give up a role when it's outdated.
God grant his mortal soul salvation,
God grant that in my careless art,
God spare me from the apparition,
Goes out of us when youth is dead
Gone blind with tears, in full submission,
Gone numb with terror, Tanya shivers . . .
Gone silent and forever dark.
Good God, man, don't you find it wearing
'Good God, man, where's your second? Where?'
Good Petushkv, to Olga bounds;
'Goodbye, Onegin . . . time I went.'
Good friends no less than ardent foes
'Good gracious, how the years do fly!'
Good night.' She's now alone. All's still.
Good reasoned talk was also heard,
Go on about their special aura.
Go ride the steppe's harsh open spaces?
Grande Dame of lofty social spheres?
Great balconies and monasteries;
Great charm to private conversation;
Great heaps of straw from threshing mowers,
Great wealth and rank and reputation;
Green meads and golden cornfields lay,
Grey clouds against a sky that lowers,
Griboedov
Grow flustered when she saw his coach;
Guffawing, barking, whistles, claps,
Guillot's to fetch the pistol case.
Gulnare's proud singer* his example,
Gvozdin, Buynov, Petushkv
Gvozdin as well, that model farmer,
'Had I in any way desired
Had Lensky known the deep emotion
Had called you out in fiery pride?
Had carried back the fruits of art:
Had choked her maiden breast too much:
Had cordial hopes that he'd acquire
Had crowded deep within his heart.
Had cursed the cook in useless ire,
Had ever so engrossed a maid:
Had hungered for the fatal food;
Had long since set Eugene to groaning:
Had pictures of domestication
Had reached the age of twenty-six,
Had seized him by the collar then,
Had someone else for whom she pined
Had stirred his soul since early days.
Half drowsing,
Half humorous, half pessimistic,
Has been decreed. I may have merely
Has brought defective steeds to sell;
Has come and brought his portly wife;
Has flown to Tanya's in his need.
Has flown to someone else instead;
Has forced young boughs, I must admit,
Has lasted thirty centuries long!
Has lulled her wretchedness to sleep:
Has my Eugene directly hastened?
Has never been expressed in Russian;
Has opened up his window-trap.
Has overpraised these haughty things:
Has painted us the snow new-laid
Has pictured with a single grace,
Has so designed the human heart.
Has still not mastered postal prose.
Has struck at last: the poet stops
Has withered, withered now at last?
Has withered with the rising sun;
Have all become mere comic urges,
Have asked him to a grand soire.
Have been expecting only oysters . . .
Have brought you to my feet? What blindness!
'Have done with all your lamentations,
Have drawn from love abundant themes;
Have eaten, drunk, grown bored and stout,
Have filled the house; whole congregations
Have gone in quarantine today?
Have known poor Tanya from the past!
Have not those creatures you adore,
Have other maidens gained your places,
Have patience, friends, I beg you, pray;
Have quit the Muses, married soundly;
Have read her tortured heart at last!
Have scarcely taken cups in hand,
Have seen the Russians' tented ranks.
Have withered with each passing day
Have your fling, my dear ones, do! 
Hear my confession too, I plead,
He barely hid his angry look
He bowed to her in silence, grave . . .
He calls a sleigh as daylight's dimming;
He ceased to know infatuation,
He chose with trembling hand to pen
He climbs aboard and off they go.
He could have shown some spark of feeling
He could, it's true, from twenty paces,
He crammed his bookshelf overflowing,
He craves her pardon so completely,
He'd almost reached his eighteenth year.
He'd been entranced by Olga growing
He'd been, till now, uncertain. . . restive,
He'd better leave without delay.
He'd borne enough in former years.
He'd calland right away discussion
He'd drink his coffee, sometimes sample
He'd earned a certain reputation
He destined Olga for my wife
He'd furnish his beloved child
He'd hear mid hum and hush alike
He did at last give up his love
He did exempt from condemnation
He didn't die, or lose his reason,
He did possess the happy forte
He did respect a noble few,
He died at midday's break from labour,
He died too soon ... his death courageous,
He'd lectured gravely on desire?
He'd only teased her with some flirting,
He'd plunged in mud from Kalmuk steed,
He draped a linen mourning shroud.
He draws sweet views of rustic scenery,
He drinksall drink and all grow shrill;
He drives to Nevsky Boulevard,
He drives to bed from last night's ball,
He dropped you too in sudden fashion.
He'd shared her frolics with affection.
He'd sit at clavichord intently
He'd spent some time with him with pleasure,
He'd swim across this Hellespont;
He enterscork and bottle spout!
He enters in some apprehension;
He enters like a dead man, striding
He entertained with fond illusions
He even read some Russians too,
He fed on hope's eternal ration;
He fell in love with dark seclusion,
He felt a restless, vague ambition,
He felt it break with desperate grieving.
He fills her album's fleeting pages
He fled their noisy congregations
He found he couldn't. She enquired
He found much wrong in his position:
He found the manor fairly bustling
He frownsand all of them grow still.
He gave a ball some three times yearly,
He gave the message one quick reading,
He gives a signthe others hustle;
He got so lost in his depression,
He had sufficient Latin training
He has no voice. Without a smile,
He has to have the latest word.
He honoured too, in tears and pain,
He inwardly began to draw
He isn't here, I'm not expected. . . .
He just about went mad, I fear,
He just moved off. . . . He's turning round.'
He kept consulting watch and sun . . .
He knew a kindred soul was fated
He knew one constant source of dreaming,
He lacked, it's true, all predilection
He laughsthey all guffaw and bustle;
He lay quite still and past all feeling;
He lays a hand, as in confusion,
He leaves abruptly, calls for horse,
He left his home in disillusion
He left the rout in all its splendour
He lived, he breathed one single dream,
'He lives in Moscow. This December,
He locked himself within his den
He looked the poet so completely
He loved good merry disputations,
He loved me and for me he gave
He loves you so! . . . Why, you're like kin!
He married off his son this fall.
He might have scaled a lofty height.
He never knew, to our frustration,
He never pictured once, not he.
He never shamed, the happy creature,
He noticed nothing, took no part.
He offered her his arm. Despairing,
He once again rejects the monde.
He opens up a door. . . . What's there
He pens a lyre . . . and then a dove,
He plants a tender verse that stands
He pours out tunes that effervesce,
He praised Odessa's gardens greatly.
'He promised he would come today,'
He proudly sang with open heart
He quit one sparkling morn and sprinted
Her Moscow cousin, Princess Laura,
He racked his brains and rather thought
He rants at them, his eyes turn dread;
Her bosom heaves, her cheeks are burning,
Her bow was calm and dignified.
Her breathing stops, all sense is gone.
Her brimming eyes could hardly see.
Her cheeks retain their blazing glow
Her cherished trove of tears and bliss
Her dream disturbs her, and not knowing
He read his Gibbon and Rousseau;
He reads them out like one possessed,
Her ears resound with ringing cries,
Here practised dandies bow and slither
Here's Petushkv, the district fop;
Here's Pradt* or, better, Walter Scott!
Her eyes have opened . . . seen his face!
Her face would pale, her teeth would chatter.
Her father was a kindly fellow
Her fiancagainst her will!
Her flaxen curls, her lovely smile,
Her flowers, novels, daily labours ...
Her gaze upon his face still lingers;
Her gentle soul, athirst with aching;
Her happy dreams have animated:
Her head bent down in modest fashion,
Her head is bowed, as if she's dozing;
Her health, her calm, the smile she wore
Her heart; as if in awful fashion
Her heart consumed with lasting anguish?
Her heart is rent in two by grief.
Her heart speaks out in urgent fashion
Her hero . . . who was none the less
Her husband at the time was still
Her husband, clubman come whatever,
Her husband enters, thus arresting
He rings in haste and, with a racket,
Her lancer had to join his troop.
Her languid and abstracted air.
Her light chemise has slipped, exposing
Her lips express determination
Her long, unloosened braids of hair,
Her lordly rank's commanding ways!
Her lovely shoulder to the night.
Her lowered eyes aflame the while,
Her maiden dreams had helped unfetter
Her manner stayed the same outside,
Her morning tea upon a tray.
Her mournful air, her touching valour
He roamed the world with singing lyre
Her portrait there; it's charming, true;
Her pounding heart began to race.
Her prim conceited face alight,
Her rapid, dazzling, dancing feet.
Her rustic charms on full display.
Her same old spouse, and same old pooch
Her secret passions, and her dreams.
Her share of travel's dull delights:
Her shoulders, face, and breast. With dread
Her simple, open country heart
Her sister bore the name Tatyana.
Her sky-blue eyes, devoid of guile,
Her slender form; fierce cackles sound
Her soul awaited . .. someone's touch.
Her soul, despite herself, infected
Her soul, unmoved, grows wan and sickly;
Her stormy scenes and wails aloud
Her stricken face. When all came out
Her summer in the country mending
Her tears well up without a word
Her virgin brooding once had cherished
Her voice, her form, her graceful stance,
Her voice more soft than reed pipe's humming:
Her walks were long; a brook or knoll
Her weariness and helpless languor,
Her worth (yet cursing fate unduly)
'Her younger sister married neatly;
He sang life's bloom gone pale and sere
He sang of love, by love commanded,
He sang of parting and of pain,
He sang the rose, romantic flower,
He's brought some news to set them cheering:
He scrawled a note: he 'd be delighted.
He sees a youth, quite still, reposing
He sees before him, wondrous fair,
He sees forgotten foes he'd bested,
He sees the wilful Terek* roaring
He seldom punished any lark,
He settled where the former squire
He's ever constant, ever novel;
He's ever near. In gloomy weather
He's gulled the world . . . now let it go.'
He's happy just to be around her,
He's happy now, he's almost sane. . . .
He's hardly worth contempt, I know,
'He's here! But all those faces!
He should have spoken words of healing,
He shuts the book and, with decision,
He sleeps in blissful, sheer delight
He slept, took coffee in these quarters,
He's master here, there's no mistaking;
He smiled at Lensky's conversation.
He's off!this critic most exacting
He's off to Talon's,* late, and racing,
He sometimes even dares to cover
He sought them out with no elation
He's past the porter, up the stair,
He spends each day and night tormented
He spies a stately eagle soaring,
'He's quite forgotten us, I fear.'
He's still an honest chap, most surely.
He stays beside her when she's seated,
He steers her, gliding nonchalantly,
He's urged to seek his doctors' view,
He swore that he'd make Lensky pay
He's yours, he'll say, through thick and thin:
He takes a single glance to measure
He thought she'd blush with self-reproach,
He took her arm. She moved away . . .
He took up travel for distraction,
He treads the ice with care to test. . .
He trembles, hunts for words in vain:
He trusted all she did sincerely
He turned at last and vaguely fluttered
He used to banter rather neatly,
He waits.... At last his guest approaches:
He waits till the mazurka's through,
He was a kind and simple barin,
He was no fool; and consequently
He was preparedlike any craven
He who can feel is always fleeing
He who has lived as thinking being
He woke to find, with some elation,
He wrote thuslimply and obscurely.
He yawned alike where'er he sat,
Himself, his dinner, and his wife.
His Blackie seated on the sled,
His French valet, Guillot, runs in
His aged uncle's time was due.
His arid vanity exposed,
His blend of banter and of bile,
His blissful spirit unencumbered
His blood by slow degrees congealing,
His chance to mix in this affair
His children at their ABCs.
His clothing for the learned set.
His cold, embittered mind that seems
His collar with its beaver trimming
His daughter read or kept at home
His distant homeland he recalled.
His double glass he calmly centres
His dreams and songs all rent asunder;
His endless bent for deep reflection,
His eyes ablaze, Eugene stood waiting
His eyes aflame, Onegin rises
His eyes retain their stare; but she Sits
His eyes toward the stage and play
His father diedquite unexpected,
His father never understood
His father ran up debts galore;
His favourite sport or avocation:
His feelings and his thoughts went slack,
His figure in the looking-glass;
His former love of life was dead.
His gaze of constant inspiration,
His glasses on, he'd deign to play
His grumbling soul the hours strike,
His heart grown deaf to commendation
His heart, so full of pain, drew tight;
His incandescent Olga there.
His kinsman and his friend Eugene.
His languid brow looked strange at rest.
His languid spirit's fretful play
His life flowed onquite calm and pleasant
His living tears upon the bed
His look was still a tender dart:
His martyred shade, condemned to night,
His mind, still vacillant in reach
His moment of revenge beginning,
His mournful life in consecration! . . .
His neighbour, calling out to wake him:
His neighbour spoke: 'Well then, he's dead.'
His only form of recreation
His only torment, toil, and treasure,
His parents' dust. . . their memory's gladness . . .
* His peasants thanked their lucky fate,
His pen breathes love, not pure invention
His pencil marks with special care;
His pistols; then he put them back.
His pistol with a level gaze.
His poet's soul, his artist's mind;
His riding crop. And on she wended.
His simple, coloured shoes of bast;
His slipper or his magazine!
His slow advance, was first to raise
His sombre wit and biting style.
His soul aflame with virgin fire.
His soul still knew the warm effusion
His strangeness that was more than seeming,
His stricken, sick, extinguished eyes,
His stubborn, thrusting horns held low
His tea and rum at once renouncing,
His thoughts had wandered far apart;
His 'true ideal' and hovered round her
His unexpected reappearance,
His very memory now has fled
His views on morals ever mellow,
His wedding day two weeks ahead;
His wife herself, we ought to add,
His world a closed and silent door?
Hm, hm, dear reader, feeling mellow?
Holds but oblivion in the end.
Holds shame in savage dread, alas.
Horace
'How Tanya's grown! It seems, my dear,
How blest, shy lover, to be granted
How changed Tatyana is!
How deep his stricken heart is shaken!
How dull to hear the same objections,
How early he could stir or worry
How early on he could dissemble,
However dazzling to the sight
However great her shock or strain,
However much I loved you, dear,
However much the situation
However, reader, we may wonder . ..
How keen his glance, how bold and tender;
How long ago did they, warmhearted,
How long it took me to forget
How many echoes it imparts!
How nature's lively renovation
How nobly in a sense you acted,
How often in the summer quarter,
How often, on the course I charted,
How often on the shores of Tauris,*
How oft. . . forlorn and separated
How oft have tearful poets chances
How oft in childhood days
How oft, mid far Caucasia's glories,
'How oft within his arms I lay,
How quick she's mastered, how securely,
How right toward me that awful day:
How sad I find your apparition,
How sad is faded passion's trace! . . .
How sad that youth, with all its power,
How self-oblivious he could seem!
How sensuous her wondrous gazes! . . .
How shrewdly he could be inventive
How surely She's taken up the role she plays!
How wicked spleen had once before
How wrong I've been! And how tormented!
Huge horns and bony fingers swerving
Hussars on leave come racing hither
I ask you now to tell me truly,
I cannot resurrect my soul.
I can't remember much of late.
I can't, though, readers, help but care
I can't translate this phrase, I find.)
I close. I dare not now reread. . . . 
I couldn't even count them all.'
'I couldn't sleep ... #62038; nurse, it's stifling!
I dared not trust in love again:
I daresay better-looking too,
'I'd be alone now . . . leave me, nurse.
I'd choose the elder one instead
I'd grieve to quit this world's dim light
I'd have you with your art refashion
I didn 't yield to sweet temptation
I'd much prefer words harsh and chill,
I'd not have known you then at all,
I don't know why; but in the end
I'd play
I drag about like some poor laggard.
I'd sip my Turkish coffee sweet.
I'd swear it's from some novel's pages!'
I envision In opening my soul to you?
I even now would worship balls.
I face another complication:
I fall anointed,
I fear; And nowadays I find more pleasing
I fear that in this meek petition
I fear that lingonberry brew
I feel her breath upon my face!
If her prim tomcat sat protected
I find a faultless Russian style
I find their friendship much too dear.
I first tried silence and evasion; 
If with your pistol you'd struck down
If you recall your Tanya still,
If you were with me still, my friend,
I gave my word, but, Lord,
I get confused . . .' 'But tell me, nanny,
I give it here in feeble dress:
I give myself to harmless pleasures
Ignored our journals all too gladly,
Ignoring reason's condemnation,
I got so scared . . . my tears kept falling;
I have no leisure for retailing
I have of old relied upon
I have them, and I quote them here:
I hear at last your magic voice!
I hear the ring of glass and cup;
I hope we part in satisfaction. . .
'I hope you'll stay?' 'Dear cousin Laura!'
I know that gentle Parny's* lays
I know that in your heart reside
I know that you'll agree, my reader,
I know you'll feel a deep distress 
I lack the strength for true repentance,
I leave your world of quiet joys
I like a sandy slope of late,
I liked his caustic disputation
I liked his natural bent for dreaming,
I liked his ways and we made friends.
I liked it once no less than you,
I live, I writenot seeking fame;
I lived back then in dry Odessa . ..
I'll bet Onegin woke at dawn.'
I'll cease one day to be a poet
I'll corner him and catch his coat
'I'll die,' she whispers to the dawn,
I'll finish up another day.
I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
I'll give a father's simple greetings,
I'll glance at house and garden plot.'
I'll grant the censor's right to shine
I'll make them quarrel yet again,
I'll never know. But none the less,
I'll never let that foul depraver
I'll say without wrought-up insistence
I'll see this Phyllis so provoking
I'll see you in the day ahead....
I'll show the children's secret meetings
I'll sprinkle you with holy water,
I'll take the letter, never fear.
I'll tell it all in detailed style
I'll think up speeches tenderhearted,
Illumined sadly by Diana,
I longed to join the waves in pressing
I long for peace, for simple fare:
I lost my way and recollected
I love my dear Tatyana so!
I love their feetalthough you'll find
I love youth's wanton, fevered madness,
I love you (why should I dissemble?);
I love you with a tender yearning,
I married. . . .
I'm duelling with a friend of mine.
(I'm fond of friendly conversation
I'm good for nothing now, I fear;
I'm grateful now in every way. . . .
'I'm happy, love . . . it's true, you know.'
I might describe in terms more knowing
I might have found (who knows?) another
Immersed in gloom beyond recall,
Immersed in thickly oozing muck.
Immobile, mute, and cherub-faced;
Immodestly I'd seek to borrow
'I'm not.''Well then, why not tonight?
I'm not quite in the mood just now.
I'm old; my mind ... it does get muddled.
I'm on the verge of tears and wailing!'
Impassioned days and idle hours,
Impatient, but in no great panic,
Implacable, to all resistant,
Implored me, and in resignation
Imploring aspect, mute replies
Imported pipes of Turkish amber,
Impossible for mind to know;
I'm sick at heart and all upset,
I'm sure you'll find him most engaging
I'm sure you've known provincial misses;
I'm thinking of Onegin, love;
I'm trying hard to pay attention;
I must have known a thousand pages
'I'm weeping. . . . Oh, at this late hour,
I'm writing you this declaration
I'm . . . you know, nurse ... in love, not ill.'
I'm young and still robust, you see;
(In Chapter One, if you recall),
In French he could and did acutely
In Lafontaine's* insipid manner.
In Mother Earth where he's at rest.'
In Muslim paradise complete,
In Olga's breast! What shoulders too!
In album drawings all through town.
In all her schemes he'd never probe;
In all the cups; without a sound
In all the sterile words they use
'In all this world what's more perverted
In ancient hall or modern flat.
In anguished writhing, almost manic,
In anguish, with his heart forsaken,
In any case, here's my advice:
In any novelyou'll discover
In arid gossip, questions, news
In bed, beneath her silken curtain,
In bonnets and malignant poses;
In bottle with the pitch still clinging,
Incessantly the serpent calls
In cherished dreams I sometimes stand
Inconstancy grew too fatiguing;
In crosses or a jotted note,
In current fashions of toilette,
In dancing too his step was light,
In days of dreams and dissipations
In days when I still bloomed serenely
In deaf eternity's grim shade,
Indeed the poet's fervent speech,
Indifferent to admirers' roses;
Indifferent to the views they hold,
In dim Moldavia's vacant waste,
'In dry Odessa'so said I. I might have said:
In duels a purist doctrinaire,
In early youth he'd been the prey
I need, And I submit to it securely.
I need to know when I awaken, 
In fact. . . Good Lord, my wits are bleak!
In fiery dust before her eye,
In following where pleasure calls!
In girlish pranks; but grisly stories
In glasses and a torn old coat,
Inhale the frostdust, gather snow
In heaven's peaceful desert flying,
In hired coach towards the ball.
In hopes that he (on charge) might squeeze
In just her cap and quilted gown.
In just such albums, friends, I too
In liveried ranks where'er she calls,
In love with Tanya like a boy;
In maidens' albums, thought it keen
In man's attire to pay a call
In missives writ in love's defence
In mud waist-high the houses snuggle;
In noisy haste the throng departs;
In our backwoods, as you'll allow,
In our day too, let's not forget),
I now mix water with my wine.
In pale blue shafts from chimney ends.
In pallid swarms the patients press,
In passing that I speak as much
In passing, though, one observation:
In philosophical seclusion
In pleasant hubbub morn's awaking!
In pledge of beauty and of good,
In pledge of meeting you, my friend; 
In praise of him who made the world.
In public speaks a word or two,
In quick succession silhouettes
In quite a keen, old-fashioned way,
In racing droshkies bound for pleasure
In russet wig and fine pince-nez.
In sad Moldavia she turned tender
In saturnine romanticism.
In savage glee; all eyes turn round,
In search of pleasure's sweet profusion;
In sheepskin coat and scarlet sash.
Inside her hut a girl is singing,
Inside her, stormy passion's seething;
Inside itall is hushed and stark,
Inside our Lyce* garden wall
Inside that modish bachelor cell.
Inside the pans. Screwed fast to metal,
In silence Moscow's youthful graces
In silence at the window bay.
In silence to destroy each other. . . .
In silence to instruct the fair!
In silver curves begins to gleam.
In some old tattered almanac
In something somehow, have we not?
In springtime on the meadow's green,
Instead, her silken sash untying,
Instead of bristling like a beast;
Instructs his man as well to hurry:
Instructs us in a moral way
In such a burst of moral fire,
In such an honest, artless fashion?
In summer he'd get up by seven
In sunset's glow, the murky light
In swirls about the china pot.
In taking joy while loving not.
In talk of Olga. Love's a bore!
In tattered nightcap and his vest.
Intelligence and handsome face.
In that brief instant then, who couldn't
In that forsaken, distant place
In them, though, nothing ever alters;
In these odd lines of my invention
In this case, though, one has to say
In this forgotten country dwelling
In this serene and glory-laden
In time, I promise, I'll not fail
In time he might have changed profoundly,
In toast to his attractive neighbour . . .
Into the fields, my friends, pell-mell!
Into the open field to gaze,
In trade for tallow and for trees;
In uniform? The one not talking . ..
In vain my searching eyes enquire,
In wavy carpets glistening bright;
In wedlock we would both be broken.
In what grim desert, madman, banished,
In what new guise is he returning?
In which a maiden heart had wept;
In which our age is well displayed
In whose bright company I've known
In winter, when the shade of night
In winter with the hearth before it,
In your imported coach, I pray,
In your slim tracks I'll stray no more,
I plead with tears upon my face 
I pray, May I not roam too far astray. 
I pray you, heed my sound advice,
I read a little, often sleep,
I read it with an ache inside me
I recollect the ocean rumbling:
I roam the shore,* await fair weather,
Is Saturday. Her mother's sent
Is affectationnothing more.
Is always angry, sullen, mute
Is barren steppeland all around,
Is bound by any righteous wife
Is brought in bottle chilled and ready
I scare a flock of ducks from resting;
Is checked, relined, and soon made fast.
Is dressed, undressed, and dressed again?
Is duty free and rather fine.
I search on all the paths I wander;
Is first to toast her where he stands,
Is gone; the snake of recollection
Is half a crane and half a cat.
I shed with you sweet tears too late;
Is held in high esteem at Court?
'Is he the same, or is he learning?
I shrink with shame and fear. 
Is incoherent rot, or worse;
I sing a youthful friend of mine. 
I sing strange whims and aberrations, 
Is it because her simple heart
Is it because we never tire
Is it perhaps my new ascension
Is just another lantern's blur.
Is just as meek and deaf, it's true,
Is just the trembling moon, alas. . . .
Is lacking yet one feature badly:
Is neither cold nor too effusive;
Is often easy, even nice.
I spent my days of deepest bliss?
Is quite alone. Some minutes there
'Is she in love?''With whom, I wonder?
Is silver bright with frosted snow.
Is surer far than friends or kin:
Is sure to fall. . . and so will you.
I start upon an untrod way
Is that it, friend?'Far from it. Nay!
Is this the lot you've been assigned?
Istmina* takes up her stand.
I swear I don't know what to do;
Is what we like and call our own?
I take a stroll. Inciting urges,
Italian voices ringing loudly;
It called him out and did it well.
It came so close!. . . But now my fate
It charmed me too, in other days:
It fizzes, foams, and bubbles lightly
I thank you for your host of treasures,
It hardly mattered to my friend,
It has, I know, association
It has its contradictions, clearly,
I think I must be dreaming, dear. . . .
It hints to probing, ardent glances
It hissed and sent its vapour steaming
I thought: in freedom, peace of mind,
I thought she might accept him then;
It may be he was born to fire
It may be now your inclination T
I too had parted with convention,
I too have gazed in rapt attention
I too there used to saunter forth,
I tore away my grieving heart;
It reawakened Tanya's heart.
I tremble with malicious glee;
It's Lensky's troika, three fine roans;
It's Lensky . . . with Eugene! 'Oh dear!'
Its ancient domes and spires streaming
Its blood ran hot with life's own heat.
It's cold and dark within the dell.
Its countless lampions burning bright;
It's grey Filtievna, who's bringing
Its happy rights ... as grand as those
It's hard to bear (as you well know)
It's hard to face a long succession
Its hatreds, hopes, and loves still beat,
Its legend lets the stranger know:
Its loves and hates, its joy and sadness,
Its magic stream brought forth no end
It's my turn now to make a speech.
Its noisy feasts and grand events,
'It's nothing.' And away he went.
'It's nothing, nanny, be at ease,
It's not your mind I'm talking of,
It's now the British Muse's fables
It speaks to me in words I know.
It's pleasant to provoke a foe;
It's pleasant when you see him staring
It's sacred to Apollo's choir;
Its thunder once could even rack
It still retains its pristine joys:
It's time for flowers, labours, heat,
'It's time for something new,' he muttered,
It's time, it's time! I bid her hail;
It's time: my pen demands a pillow; Nine cantos have I duly wrought, And now the ninth and final billow To joyful shore my bark has brought. All praise to you, #62038; nine Camenae,* etc.
'It's time, my sweet, to greet the day;
'It's time she married . . . awful waste. . . .'
It's time that she were settled too,
It's time to quit this dreary lee
'It's time to rise! Past six . . . come on!
Its time will pass without my knife,
Its token beauty stokes the fires,
It's true! The lady didn't shiver,
It's true: by self-hypnotic action,
'It's up to me,' he thought, 'to save her.
Its want of purpose is a crime;
It's where I find . . .''More pastoral singing!
Its wondrous veil to stand uncovered;
Its worthlessness needs no professing,
I turned to flame, I felt all shaken, 
It wasn't that she'd read him, really,
It waxes, stirs, turns seething wave,
It wears with pride its recent glory:
I used to meet with now and then:
I've closed my eyes to phantoms gleaming,
I've drawn a plan and know what's needed,
I've dreamt of Moscow far away!
I've faith in you and do not tremble;
I've got no strength . . . this weary breast
I've got the scene in mind so clearly:
I've known great beauties proudly distant,
I've learned the voice of new desires
I've looked it over most severely;
I've marvelled at their haughty manner,
I've read your words and they evoke
'I've suffered ballets long enough,
I've talked so long that I've required
Ivn Petrvich ... no more bright;
I vow, Has ever had and hasn't now!
I vow, Retracting it would suit me better.
I wait for you . . . and your decision: 
I wanted with Albani's glory*
I was embittered, he depressed;
I watch with jealous trepidation
I won't be long . . . just leave the taper.
I would have asked youyes, it's true
I would have wished a finer treasure
I wouldn't say that ladies never
I write .. . and want no more embraces;
Just cabbage soup and room to spare.
Just casual friends who'd often call
' 'Just half a glass, old boy, be sparing. . .
Just killing time that way each night?'
Just lies in bed without a word,
Just like the moon upon her throne,
Just looked at himher visage bleak
Just love yourself and ease the pain,
'Just never mind . . . now look up there . . .
Just now though, friends, I feel too tired
Just picks her up and rushes on;
Just plays my stomach false,
Just says: "I can't", then broods away,
Just send your grandson, will you please.'
Just sits with lowered head, remote;
Just so! The tomb that lies before us
Just so a butterfly both quivers
Just so a casual guest at night
Just so a hare in winter shivers,
Just so a sapling sheds its leaf
Just so a soldier, old and lame,
Just so a youthful rake reflected,
Just so in carefree song I paid
.' Just solemn odes? .. . On all our pages?!
Just takes his leave and drives away
Just tell me, dearest, what you need.
Just what the dreadful vision meant.
Keeps leafing through some book she's reading,
Keeps nothing of its heart concealed:
Kept lessons light and rather plain;
Kibitkas, britzkas, coaches, sleighs.
Lacking the fervent dedication
Lamented much by friend and neighbour,
La morale est dans la nature des choses*
La sotto i giorni nubilosi e brevi,
Last night you scared me, 'pon my word!
Late from Tambv, a witty fellow
Left Tanya moved; but she felt sad
Lest I forget of whom I sing
Lest monde or husband misconstrue
Let God's own lightning strike you now!
Let me repay you with a vow
Let not the poet's soul grow bitter
Let's all go have a nice long rest. .. .
'Let's go.'
Let's grant to fevered youthful days
Let's listen to their conversation
Let's prick vainglory first with hope,
Let's trace a winding brooklet's flow
Lies Moscow with its stones of white,
Lies snoring with his portly partner.
Life pulses full as here and there,
Life's essence . . . and enjoyed my fill.
Like Byron's Harold, lost in trances,
Like Chatsky,* straight from boat to ball.
Like Cypris* bathed in morning's light.
Like Hippocrene* it sparkles brightly,
Like Petrarch then, he calms the heart,
Like ancient foes in mad dissension,
Like any poetopen, caring,
Like convicts sent in dreaming flight
Like crimson lips without a smile,
Like down from Eol's lips she races;
Like drunken Delvig* at a fest!
Like empty sounds exist no more,
Like fair Lenore,* on moonlit nights
(Like fashion's very illustration)
Like flighty Venus when she chooses
Like giddy hopeso gay and clever,
Like him, she dressed as taste decreed.
Like leaves dank autumn rots away.
Like modish verse devoid of reason,
Like noble Regulus,* he bowed,
Like shadow or a faithful wife.
Like smoke across an azure ocean.
Like some grim shade of night's creating;
Like spectres in a bleak procession.
Like that poor tax collector there?
Like verse with prose, like flame with fountain:
Like you and me, to being nice?

Lit by the sun as it paraded;
Live images, or wit in rhyme,
Lives out his life a proper sage,
Load up your carriages to bursting,
Long dormant feelings, scarce remembered.
Long live Bordeaux, our noble friend!
Long rambles, reading, slumber's blisses,
Long since her heart's sweet agitation
Long since her keen imagination,
Look Tanya over good and slow;
'Look quickly to your left, my dear.'
Looks back and answers: 'Agafon.'*
Looks outand sees with some dismay,
Lord Byron, his caprice succeeding,
Lord Byron's portrait on the wall,
Lorgnette in hand and senses foaming,
Lost in a past he found more mellow;

Love's luring phial, you who once

Made me a drunken, love-filled dunce!)
Made meetings dull at one another's;
Mad with regret and anguished feeling,
Majestic wigs and heels of red.
Make Chateaubriand's works seem grey;
Makes off with Lensky's future bride.

May his example profit others;
May in a trice be swept away:

Might walk with him life's humble way!
Might well have made them friends once more!
Might well have played a better part
Might well have raised, before it ceased,
Mistakes in grammar charm the mind.
Monotonous and mad procession,
Monsieur l'Abb, a needy fellow,
Monsieur l'Abb was shown the gate.
More bored than usual.''No, the same.
More clearly nowthank Godher passion
More common sense if I'm to grow,
More happy he who knew them not,
More often, though, my two recluses
More often visit my abode;
More pleasant yet, my friends, if he
More rosy than the dawn before
More tender to the wounded beast;
More wondrous still and still more fearful:
Moscow! Russia's favourite daughter!
Mot, that wine most blest and heady,
Moustaches, leaps, heel-pounding noise
Much bolder than most healthy men,
'Must be a Mason;* drinks, they say . . .
Must occupy my pen for now;
Mute monument to fond reflection:
Muzhiks and merchants, Cossack guards;
My Tambov poet takes in tow;
My Tanya's conquest taking wing,
My Tanya starts to understand
My Tanya, though, is so forlorn.
My bold Buynov guides expertly
My country's honour will demand
My dear Elvina, I adore it
My dear one, you are doomed to perish;
My deep respect for your emotion,
My fair Tatyana's noblest trait. . .
My faith in you and your affection; 
My fertile fancies spring to life.
My first few stanzas I once read
My fleeting, youthful days were spent.
My flighty mistress at my side.
My former master lived here too;
My gentle Muse's magic spell
My god! How stern that haughty brow,
My goddesses! You vanished faces!
'My goodness, girl, you must be ailing;
My heart and tongue once used to soar,
My hero and of course I vow
My hero's features here with mine
My last poor pence . . . remember, friend?
'My left? But why? It seems like gawking.'
My life till now has been a token 
My lovely lily, stalk and blade;
My lyre sings! And in the gloaming
My mind and will are almost broken, 
My most esteemed and honoured reader!
My muddled pupil, in distraction,
My name, or breathe a single word. . . .
My novel's shape or what would be.
My pen has lost its disposition
My poor, poor Lensky! Yes, she mourned him;
My present novel's Chapter One.
'My second?' said Eugene directly.
My secret shame, had I discerned 
My services to save your houses:
My soul cries out and longs to offer
My soul preserved their secret features;
My soul's a stranger to its call;
My span on earth is all but taken, 
My sparkling youth, before you flee!
My spirit's own newborn creation!
My springtime's golden days so dear?
My straying pen no longer traces,
My student cell turned incandescent;
My stylish house where princes dine
My thanks to you. With you I've tasted,
My tribute to the mountain maid,
'My uncle, man of firm convictions* . . .
My word, that little devil courted!
My youth betrayed, it's time to show
Naively poured his secrets out;
Napoleon, drunk with fresh success,
Nasce una gente, a cui l'morir non dole.*
Nay, ever more intensely quaking,
Nearby St Chariton's it ended
Near waters sparkling in the still,
Neath flow'ring cherries and acacias,
Neath passion's rains they green and thicken,
Necker
Neglected bridges rot and fall;
Never come to listen in
Never come to spy on us
Next day as dawn was just advancing,
Next day, for sure, they'd drive at dawn
Night falls; the moon begins parading
No Grandison in Russian dress.
No answer came. Eugene elected
No cards, no balls, no poets' feats
No fine parquet could hope to muster
No funds on renting fresher horse,
No inns exist. At posting stages
No jealous lady trained lorgnette,
No lasting truths or dissertations
No lines a poet had invented,
No longer cheered the family group.
No madrigals of mere convention
No maiden's lips were equal bliss,
No matter: childish hope appears
No matter; fate's decree is just;
No matter what he tries to do;
No modish connoisseur his glasses,
No more at dawn does shepherd need
No, never midst the fiercest blaze
No, never once did passion's flood
No, nothing touched his sombre heart,
No plaything of the mob's conventions
Nor Seneca's, nor Byron's pages,
Nor any vulgar gutter verse,
Nor bowed her head in subjugation;
Nor did he care what secret tome
Nor did he scorn the odd review
Nor does his horn at midday sound
Nor does she put her seal's impression
Nor even Fashion Plates Displayed
Nor foreign beauties' magic spell,
Nor hear the ages bless his days.
Nor known this bitter heartache's swelling.
No rosy cheek that I might kiss,
Nor pleasure's rounds, nor learning's well,
Nor read its novel's final pages;
Nor scorned the social mob's decisions;
Nor see that noxious worm devour
Nor wanton sighs, nor tender glances
Nor was it that she much preferred
Nor watch this two-day blossom fade
Nor yet the Muse, his true vocation,
No sapient truths, no pretty scenes
No secret crimes or passions gory
No sooner here than he went roaming,
No sooner would the cannon, sounding,
No spot of ink on oaken floors. O
No stir disturbs the silence round,
No surer place for declarations,
Not aiming yet, the foes took boldly
Not daring once to steal away!
Not even in some chance remark;
Not far from our unhappy maid,
Not far from where the youth once flourished
Not once all day does thought but flicker,
Not only woe.. . . It's true, my dear,
No trace at all of last night's fret,
No trace of Tanya from the past.
Not thinking of the proud world's pleasure,
November marched across the land.
Now I beg you, go!
Now Tanya is alone, forsaken!
Now all is hushed. Tatyana sleeps.
Now carried off by fate, a bride,
Now chatting, now a silent guide,
Now don't refuse, it's time you went.'
Now doomed by death to pass unheard;
Now doomed to wither unfulfilled!
No welcome feast did she prepare
Now every man has foes in life,
Now gazes at the vacant park. ...
Now greetings come, congratulations;
Now greets the dawning season brightly.
Now home's our heroes' destination,
Now is the time, you hibernators,
Now my Eugene, Chadyev's* double,
Now nature, tremulous, turns pale
Now stoop to play so base a part?
Now streams of greyish powder settle
Now tea is brought. I like to tell
Now the mazurka's call is sounded.
O
O Brenta!* I shall yet rejoice,
ONEGIN DRIVES TO ASTRAKHAN, AND FROM THERE TO THE CAUCASUS
ONEGIN THEN VISITS TAURIS [THE CRIMEA]
ONEGIN TRAVELS FROM MOSCOW TO NIZHNI NOVGOROD
Oblivion when tempests flourish,
Observed by none, and near despair,
'Odessa gushing' And even so have told no lie.
Odessa's charms in splendid verse,
Odessa's flooded, drowned, and stuck,
O dreams! Where has your sweetness vanished?
Of Richardson and of Rousseau.
Of Tanya's letter from my hand.
Of acting foolish, raving madly,
Of all desire at length grown sick,
Of all digressions from the past.
Of all that touches art or acting,
Of ancient customs unforgot.
Of ancient facts and fables too
Of anecdotes of ages past:
Of angry heirs in hot debate
Of bonneted Academician
Of both young girls with superstition;
Of briar blooms, and freshets sound.
Of brilliant Nina Voronskya,*
Of brushes for the modern male
Of but one thing, till our next meeting.
Of censuring what others do?
Of choral dances, garden swings.
Of chosen ones whom men should heed,
Of churches, belfries, stately homes!
Of course it's so. And yet be wary,
Of course not all his pranks succeeded
Of course the love of tender beauties
Of dinners stretching out of sight,
Of elegy in all its guises
Of endless years of separation,
Of every raging mad delusion,
Of faraway Eugene the more.
Of feasts and foods and corks and such
Of feeling, thought, and magic sound.
Of fishermen were dimly gleaming.
Of free and easy conversation,
Off to be charmed by dreams and cheered,
Off where the grass grows dense and high,
Of glory, country, proud seclusion.
Of hallowed letters: E and O.
Of history's annals full of must,
Of household urchins with a whoop
Of how these two had grown apart,
Of kennels, and of distant kin,
Of ladies and their modish pets.
Of leaves that perished in the fall,
Of liquor, and of hay brought in,
Of long-stemmed glasses . . . (quite as slender
Of maiden's touch and friendship's clasp.
Of me the world shall soon grow dumb;
Of naked linden, birch, and ash
Of neighbour clans have come in drays,
Of neighbours' feasts and rounds of mirth;
Of oligarchic colloquies,
Of one consumptivewan and sickly.
Of other scenes have I grown fonder:
Of our old home, its walks and flowers,
Of passions and escaped their lot;
Of pistol, sword, and ready glove.
Of plump and living anchorites,
Of rich rewards and peerless trances;
Of secret torments unabated .... T
Of shaded, idle times like this,
Of silence at a lonely hour;
Of sleepless nights, light inspirations,
Of some fair mistress long departed
Of some misfortune ill defined.
Of some most solemn state affair;
Of something vague, of mists and rain;
Of southern winters, this is clear;
Of steady labour made him ill,
Of sundry chapters as my suit:
Of those they love? Good sense declares
Of twisted slanders might combine
Of usage and pronunciation;
(Of verses I won't even speak);
Of wandering tribes; and like a child,
Of what, with fashion's sense of duty,
Of white-skinned, dark-eyed country maid;
Of whom lifelong the verdict ran:
Of wildest youth's most fervent days
Of woods and mills and streams and lands;
Of writerswhom I won't condemn
Of youthful ecstasies unknown,
Of youthful feeling, youthful thought,
Of youthful springtime's vast ambition,
'Oh God! I'll see her. . . and today!
Oh God!my blood can still turn cold
Oh, God, my friend, what sheer perfection
Oh, Grandison! ... of course I do!'
'Oh, I'm in love,' again she pleaded
Oh, Olga's every trait.... But glance
Oh, Tanya, it's a sorry state;
Oh, Tanya sweet, come over here
Oh, all that I might then entreat!. ..
Oh, blest is he who joins his pain
Oh, blest is he who lives believing,
Oh, blest who in his youth was tender;
Oh, by the way, Dame Larin seems
Oh, come, Oh, come, I am thy mate!'
'Oh, come! Our world was quite another!
Oh come now, friend, it's all the same.
Oh, cousin, do you still remember
Oh, happy he who's known the ferment
Oh, hearken to my woeful call:
'Oh, let me be now . . . I'm in love.'
Oh, many, many days have fled
Oh, much, too much you've stolen, Fate!
'Oh, nanny, life's so full of dangers,
'Oh, nanny, please, that's not the question,
Oh, never know these frightful dreams, My dear Svetlana!
Oh, never mindhe'll make them all.
'Oh, nurse, a favour, please . . , and hurry!'
'Oh nurse, your wits are all befuddled!'
O horrors! No, she'd better stay
O how I envied then the waves
'Oh, tell me, do, Tatyana love,
Oh then at least, my tender years
'Oh, what's your name?' He hurries on,
Oh, where and why do I now flee?
Oh, why have I no bullet's bruises?
Oh yes, I'll go!'and straightaway
Old Aunt Elena never falters
'Old X is quite a splendid man.'
Old age divines with glasses on
Old-fashioned Russian welcome treat.
Old women beamed as she went by;
O lovely land, you shores of Tauris,
On Christmas eve, he paid a call:
On Sundays at his window station,
On any theme but our own plight.
On balls I madly used to dote:
On bivouac; then hears with dread
On breast and falls. His misted eyes
Once Vyzemsky* sat down beside her
Once free, I seek again the blending
Once more an idler, now he smothers
Once more can't wait till day is past.
Once more he counts the hours, pacing;
Once more he turned to books and sages.
Once more imagination surges,
Once more in solemn, rapt attention
Once more that touch ignites and urges
Once more the love . . . once more the dart!
Once used to you ... I'd cease, I fear;
On coming home, the youth inspected
On coming to, she looks around her:
On dining chairs have bedded gladly;
On each in turn they'd ruminate.
One aims a gun at ducks on high;
One constant wish forever gleaming,
One couldn't label her a beauty;
One craves the scent that war exudes;
One dreams of ruling multitudes;
One ever-present cause for pain!
One foot upon the ground she places,
'Onegin, I was then much younger,
Onegin! 'Oh!'And light as air,
Onegin, dressing in a flurry,
Onegin fired! The hour fated
Onegin kept his stallion ready
Onegin, late, made explanation.
Onegin lifts an arm to rout
Onegin lived in his own heaven:
Onegin, mid those mournful crowds,
Onegin, noting Lensky'd left,
Onegin now has left the scene
Onegin, pausing, thought of me.
Onegin's Letter to Tatyana
Onegin sits amid the roar
Onegin snatches up a knife,
Onegin stares at her intently,
Onegin stares with all his soul:
Onegin's taste in horse and coach.*
Onegin's uncle, sick and dying,
Onegin, taking it, withdrew
Onegin then, while still not ceasing
Onegin, though, is fading quickly;
Onegin turned to Lensky next: 'Shall we begin?'
Onegin was profoundly stirred:
Onegin was, so some decided
Onegin, wasting, has the air
Onegin, who was widely taken
Onegin, with his first reaction,
One has a rooster's head on top;
One is entranced by rhyme as I;
One likes to bask in melancholy;
One loosened curl with soft caress
One melancholy joker found her
' One might to this take sharp exception,
One moment backa breath's duration
One occupies himself with wine:
One splendid house is all alight,
One swats at flies in mindless folly;
One thought within his heart enfolds him:
On every side you seem to find
One worthy of your soul's perfection,
On "former days" and "times of yore";
Ongin, my good friend and brother,
On goose's neck a skull seemed cheerful,
On granting him his resting place
On hacked-out bluish ice that lay
On 'kinfolk' and their implications?
On ladies he has yet to meet.
On leaving some delightful ball,
On little dishes her preserves,
Only the sound of sentries calling,
(On meeting her at some dull aunt's)
On melting snowas if he's dozing
On misty eves, she led me down
On my long work as I grow older! 
On one whose heart has long been dead,
On proper form; he'd not allow
On rain and flax and cattle care. . . .'
On reaching land at last. Hurray!
On scaring off some timid lover
On soft Italian nights I'll go
On stilts alone can feeble feet
On stormy Zeus's orders clearly:
On top of which, they're so unerring,
Onto the porch and fussed about
On treacherous ice in blunted shoe,
On unknown faces on the stages?
On which, herewith, these observations:
On winter nights all dark and cold.
On yielding rugs in rich profusion;
. Oppressive days indeed of late.
Or Cleopatra with his jeers,
Or Eden's joys for us are moot.
Or Freischutz* played with timid skill
Or, God forbid, some wretched breeder
Or Veuve Cliquot, the finest class,
Or all the passions they inspire;
Or am I now inured to gladness;
Or arm in arm they make their rounds
Or arrow passes byall's right:
Or as a sad and raving creature,
Or as, more tenderly I'd say,
Or blush, or suddenly turn white .. .
Or borrow thenfrom me, let's say.'
Or brawling boy to take offence,
Or brings her smothered tears relief;
Or chanced upon the sad affair.
Or check accounts. You'd rather not?
Or chill corruption's deadly grasp,
Or cunningly start altercations;
Or did the time of tears soon pass?
Or does he play the outcast still?
Or do we mark with lamentation
Or else (and here I'm far from jesting),
Or else he'd patch things up between them
Or else ... or else . . . may God defend you!
Or else turned poet (an obsession
Orestes with his friend here vied,*
Or even Demon of my pen!*
Or even let an eyebrow quiver,
Or fetch her kerchief when it falls.
Or floating on the drowsy river,
Or for the passing of a note.
Or frighten with despairing tongue.
Or games of tag upon the heather;
Or gloomy Melmoth, lost and pleading,
Or go on dropping words of wit
Or had Tatyana had some notion
Or had a happy fate required
Or halt this heavy dream of mine
Or harden and congeal alone,
Or heard approaching uninvited,
Or hell's own demon of temptation?
Or hint of inner lyric grace;
Or if amid the fields one day
Or if she happened anywhere
Or if, unconsciously or not,
Or if upon her left she'd spy
Or in a grave dispute he'd wear
Or in the question mark he wrote.
Or judge yourself how it must look
Or kiss the border of her dress.
Or laugh it off and, through some ruse,
Or lulled by Lethe, has he slumbered,
Or manufactures for delight,
Or maybe he's just dedicated,
Or maybe he was merely fated
Or maybe merely faulty grammar
Or passed unpunished or unheeded,
Or passes by without a greeting:
Or perched on granite by the shore.
Or plaintive horn would make us shiver.
Or press her lips together tight.
Or saddened by the re-emergence
Or scholar in a yellow shawl!
Or seek some other sweet employment:
Or see the Russian muse of dance
Or send a wish by mail at least;
Or shall my mournful gaze alight
Or so at least with joy he thought.
Or sometimes Idol mio* sweetly
Or sometimes after dinners dreary,
Or sometimes merely bows on meeting,
Or some young girl from town who's spending
Or sparkled in one way or other.
Or sparkling wit as cold as prose;
Or stand the sound of friendly chatter.
Or suddenly from Million Street
Or sultry breast on which to languish.
Or tell them all the city news.
Or that I now have wealth and rank;
Or that by morn they'd be debating,
Or that my husband, maimed in battle,
Or through the magic crystal see
Or trying gravely to convince
Or turn a poet in despair.
Or turned to heaven, softly crying,
Or use those sorts of affectation
Or verse that Bogdanvich* wrote.
Or was he profligate and hale
Or what if he himself, not thinking,
Or when I helped the poor and dying,
Or when a shooting star flew by
Or where he'd tacitly agreed.
Or where the husband, knowing truly
Or why am I not old and spare,
Or why not crippled with arthritis,
Or will he sport some other mask?
Or would my fall perhaps be sport,
O spring! ... #62038; time of love's unrest!

Our Lensky's seat, there lived and thrived
Our Mother Eve's disastrous history:
Our Russian troikas never weary;

P. A. Katenin* (whose fine poetic talent in no way prevents him from being a subtle critic as well) has observed to us that this excision, though advantageous perhaps for the reader, is none the less harmful to the work as a whole, for it makes the transition from Tatyana the provincial miss to Tatyana the exalted lady too sudden and unexplained: an observation that reveals the accomplished artist. The author himself felt the justness of this reproach but decided to omit the chapter for reasons important to him, but not to the public. Some few excerpts have been published already; we insert them here, along with several other stanzas.
PUSHKIN'S FOREWORD
Passed on in bed ... his children round,
Past diplomats and soldier-fops,
Past garden plots, small bridges, lawn,
Past gateway lions' lifted paws,
Past seedbeds to the brookso fast
Past towers, hovels, boulevards,
Past urchins, streetlamps, strolling fops,
Paved highways, linking every side,
Pelting him with cherries then, 
Perceive full well that home life means
Perceives herself as heroine 
Perceive you as a freak on show,
Perform her soaring, soulful flight?
Perfumes in crystal jars arrayed;
Perhaps I give occasion to!
Perhaps (a flattering hope's illusion!)
Perhaps along the Neva's shore
Perhaps an ancient glow of passion
Perhaps has carried off forever
Perhaps he also dimly knew
Perhaps (if fate should prove unkind!)
Perhaps in thought we reassemble,
Perhaps, my friends, by fate's decree,
Perhaps, upon the world's great stages,
Perhaps, when time had helped in quelling
Perhaps you'd like, you gentle fellow,

Petrvsky Castle. Hey! Be fleet!
Plants cabbages like old Horatius,
Plus Marmontel*just volume three.
Poised to the magic bow attendant,
Politely, but with cold directness,
Poor Lensky! In his place of resting,
Poor Lensky can't believe his eyes.
Poor Tanya burns in joyless throes;
Poor Tanya, sleepless and in pain,
Poor Tanya's plight; but every eye
'Poor Yorick!' then he murmured, shaking,
Possessed him for a moment's sway . . .
Possesses me on spring's returning,
Pour forth their warm and cheerful glows
Pour out confessions, lamentation,
Pours forth a maiden's blameless plighting.
Preoccupied by work ... or idle,
Prepared as tribute for the ground.
Prepared in trials or in grief
Prepared to conjure all night through,*
Prepared to die for love of good;
Prepares in play for protocol,
Presented him, with gloating eye,
Present me, do.''You must be joking!'
Prince N. had sent an invitation.
'Princesse, mon ange!' 'Pachette!' 'Oh, Laura!'
Proceeds to talk of this and that;
Proclaim from ship the dawn of day
Produced at large a great sensation
Profoundly loved, in its cold beauty,
Pronounced a Russian n as slightly
Proud Orpheus and Europe's pet.
Provoked amusement in the crowd
Ptri de vanit il avait encore plus de cette espce d'orgueil qui fait avouer avec la mme indiffrence les bonnes comme les mauvaises actions, suite d'un sentiment de supriorit, peut-tre imaginaire.
Pursued him through the world's commotion,
Pursue her now a good deal less.
Pursuing belles with little zest;
Put silence cunningly to use,
Put straight his wig and asked around
Put up the window ... sit by me.'
Pykhtin the lancer came from town
Qu 'crirez-vous sur ces tablettes? 
Quite ceased to tempt him any more
Quite charmed her heart when they were told
Quite curtly offered satisfaction
Quite other lines that rose unbidden
Quite pampered by a life of leisure,
Quite possibly for years on end!
Quite sure he'll find Kavrin* pacing;
Quite unadorned, her face gone white
Recall Moi'na* . . . and rejoice
Recalling, like some friend, my song.
Recall the satirist, good brother,
Recall the words of passion's heat,
(Recasting platitudes till weary)
Receive our race's hymns of praise,
Red bloody tongues and snouts and nails,
Red wine, by tumbler, night and day!' '
Refreshed the stage with comic joy,
Refused, he found quick consolation;
Regards those streams and smoky clouds,
Regretted still his past delights
Released to them the whole estate . . .
Relief from labours for a time,
Relying on a tyrant's honour,
Remained beyond her comprehension,
Remain the same; they've not been altered
Remembers him; his bride's devotion
Reminds him that it's dinner time.
Remote one moment, gay the next;
Removed to where two oaklings stand.
Renew themselves with joy, and quicken;
Repeating it a hundred ways
Repeats what mama taught to her.
Repose in peace, young poet, here!'
Responding to our journals' call,
Restored to home and its safekeeping,
Retainers crowd the gate pell-mell
Retreats for happy assignations;
Reverberates ... the cabin quivers;
Revive it with a jealous flame;
Revive my hopes with but a sign, 
Rewards you with a soft caress?
Right then and there Vladimir penned
Ripe red currants let us throw!
Romp away, sweet lassies, now, 
Rosettes, a torch, a pair of hearts;
Rouse Tanya from her bed to listen.
Rousseau (permit me this digression)
Runs to the stricken youth . . . and stares!
Rveillez-vous, belle endormie* 
Sad mist and murky gloom prevail;
Sad times to come and disillusion.
Safe in her woods and never stray.
Said Lensky in his friendly way,
Sat nanny in her quilted cassock;
Scarce breathing and bereft of speech,
Scarce-breathing lips grow still with yearning,
Scarce mindful of their love or spite.
Scarce out of infant clothes and killed!
Screened by a hill from wind's intrusion,
Sealed off at last from everybody,
Seclusion, quietthese, in fine,
Secure at last from tempest's rage,
Sed alia temporal Such sporting
Sedate Bordeaux's good quiet cheer.
Seeks Lensky out with furtive glances;
Seem sweet as youthful sins remote,
Sees her at once! Her harshness stuns him!
Sees through a crack the strangest thing
Semyn Petrvich . . . just as tight;
Sends forth rich blooms and gives sweet fruit.
Sensing the dreadful load they bore,
Set to a children's melody:
Shall I abandon every scruple
Shall I be thirty soon, in truth?
Shall I grow bored with mirth and rages,
Shall I in grim detail portray,
Shall I return?' And Tanya sighs,
Shall instantly decide his lot.
Shall once again I hear your chants?
Share meals and pastimes, thoughts and ends?
Sharp-peaked and ringed by hills, it hovers . . .
She beat the maids when she was cross
She blossomed in a maiden's ways
She blushes in appreciation,
She bounded from the porch above
She brought her gifts . . . and danced about,
She called from parlour couch to greet them.
She cannot raise her eyes to face them
She can't go on, she shuts her eyes;
She can't make sense of what she's hearing,
She casts no brazen glance around
She checked her funds and then decided,
She dare not look to see behind her,
She'd been condemned to feel desire:
She'd be quite overcome with terror,
She'd drive around to check the workers,
She'd hurry and, in agitation,
She does not bid him rise or go,
She does not say: 'Let's wait till later
She doesn't greet the winter's glow,
She doesn't see or doesn't care;
She entered the deserted gate.
She falls ....
She fell in love. For thus indeed
She finds a brother's slayer hateful
She finds all former pleasures bleak.
She finds in alphabetic order
She finds it all a priceless treasure,
She flies and breaks through lilac bushes,
She flits on tiptoe with a sigh
She found Onegin's soul reflected
She found a cue left unattended
She found a great deal more appealing;
She found a secret charm in part:
She gave no hint of agitation:
She gave the poet intimations
She hardly notes how late the hour,
She heeds and doesn't heed the roses,
She isn't hurried or obtrusive,
She just undressed and went to bed.
She kept the books, she shaved the shirkers,*
She knew the Russian language badly,
'She knows you?''We were neighbours, Prince.'
She laced her corset very tightly,
She lacked that fresh and rosy tone
She lacked the slightest predilection,
She learned their ways and soon grew wild:
She learned to use her woman's powers
She left him then. Eugene, forsaken,
She lets it lie, she mustn't linger,
She lies atop the farthest mountain
She lies there sleepless and uncertain;
She lies within his arms inertly;
She likes the stately disposition
She'll never see him . . . and be grateful,
She'll share with none, aloud like this.
She'll wonder too: 'Did Olga languish?
She loved the fictions and the fancies
She loved to greet Aurora's show,
She made her weekly bathhouse call,
She may be dreaming not of you.
She murmured something through her pain
She never learned to show affection,
She never touched a fragile finger
She pays him not the least attention,
She pays no heed to guests at all,
She pickled mushrooms for the fall,
She races down the meadow course,
She read, my friends, that king of sages
She roams in aimless desolation,
She rode with me those craggy heights!
She rose at dawn and off she started
She runs . .. but he keeps crashing on . . .
She runs, she flies; she dare not wait
She saw it all. In desolation,
She saw no friendly soul on station
She seemed the same she'd always been.
She seems the very illustration
She sees an unknown yard instead:
She shuddered, but she didn't speak,
She sighs . . . and in her soul possessing
She's in a hall; no bear at least;
She sinks in snow; the bear alertly
She sits before the windowsill.
She's levelled with a fluffy blanket
She's like that stupid moon you see,
'She's mine!' announced Eugene, commanding;
She's no coquette in any part
She softly sheds a flood of tears.
She's out the backway, down the stair
She's pale and wasted, doesn't speak!
She spied a distant hamlet's glow,
She spins away the wintry night.
She's reached the wood, the bear still tracking;
She's spread herself through field and fountain,
She's stifled here . . . and in her mind
She stands beneath the crown a bride,
She stepped inside the empty shell
She takes a garden path and sighs,
She takes no note of dawn's procession,
She took a seat beside the chair
She took it and with languid bearing
She took it with a trembling hand
She too now yawns and, as she dances,
She trembles, burns, and waits ... so near him!
She tries to flee . . . but feels too weak;
She turns all offers down completely,
She used to write, with blood, quotations
She views the winter path ahead.
She walked and walked . .. till with a shiver
She walks upon a snowy dale,
She wanders with her borrowed lovers
She wants to scream . . . but cannot speak;
She whispers in a soft refrain
She yields without conditions, boldly
Shoot pistol at an ace and hit;
'Should I go on, turn back, or what?
Should each not part once more as brother? . . .
Should they not laugh while yet there's time,
Shrieks out in stupid shock: that's me!
Shy as a doe and apprehensive,
Since I dropped sinning long ago.
Since, after all, I'm one of them.
Since dawn Dame Larin's near relations
Since then, it seems, they've hardly mattered.
Since young Tatyana with her lover,
Sing God knows whom in splendid art
Sing our secret ditty now, 
Sings out till dawn; a crimson cover
'Sit down.. . . How strange! ... I can't begin . . .
Sits ananas in splendid gold.
Sits gazing at the darkened plain.
Sleep shuns her bed, all sweetness goes,
Slow Lethe, then, with grim insistence,
Small hamlets too the eye could see
So Lensky soared as he awaited
So be it then! Henceforth I place 
So books, like women, he deserted,
So circumspect, so strict in bearing,
So dignified, so awfully smart,
So frisky-carefree with her grin,
Soft snow, knee-deep, lies all about;
So grant them, God, long life and ease!
So harsh and negative a view?
So hear me through without vexation:
So he could quickly disappear
So he might lunch with them as guest,
So here's his letter word for word.
So he returned one day to fall,
So inaccessibly serene,
So judge yourself what we'd be buying,
Sole heir to all the kin he knew.
So let him meanwhile live his life Believing in the world's perfection;
So marmot-like through winter's night
So meanwhile, friends, enjoy your blessing:
'Some are no more, and distant. . . others.'*
Some army scribbler will have written
Some bagatelle when you'd been drinking;
Some cards with me to pass the day.
Some common madrigal to please,
Some distant droshky's rumbling beat;
Some even knowingly conceded
Some fables he could sell tomorrow,
Some favourite author's fond creation:
Some feeling for Tatyana's lot,
Some fruit liqueurs and applejack,
Some future dunce with warm effusion
Some general stared her way a lot.
Some imprecision of the tongue
Some jars of jam and kitchen wares,
Some lacked all conscience; some, all sense;
Some memory of that park and lane,
Some moments passed in utter quiet,
Some moralistic novel, say,
Some mornings still abed he drowses,
Some other and more ancient spring,
Some others too might well have noted
Some pages still preserved the traces
Some pots and basins, and the rest
Some raved or lied, and some were dense;
Some sacred truth, a living word,
Some serf girls in the orchard there,
Some tea to whet their tittle-tattle;
Sometimes a shepherd sits there waiting
Some wondrous thing that she would learn.
Some works and authors even so:
Some would that ladies be required
So much of life have I neglected
Soon Olga's happy voice and beauty
Soon proved a wearisome attraction.
So peace to you, you woes of yore!
So pious and so chaste of heart,
So pleased with all he had in life:
So rend my soul, so flame my blood.
So round and fair of face is she,
So she was called Tatyana, reader.
So short a time since I baptized you!' '
So stay beneath your roof... try reading:
So thank the Lord that in this nation
So there it isthe mob's opinion!
So this is what it means to see the world!
So thus he failed to join the faction
So unconcerned with him ... so cold?
So we in fancy then were borne
So what's ahead? Ennui, ennui! .. .
So why do you pursue me now?
So why is Tanya, then, more tainted?
So wrapt in thought she hasn't heard.
'Speak ill of Moscow!
Speak out on Tanya's situation:
Spring calls you to your country seat;
Spring rays at last begin to muster
Stand fizzing on the table yet;
Stared out the window, and squashed flies.
Steel files and combs in many guises,
Steps out of doors and trains a mirror
Stern censure in your former fashion
Still fidget, freezing, in the snow,
Still glitter grandly all about;
Still has her friend, Monsieur Finemouch,
Still held his youthful mind in thrall;
Still hopeful and indeed persistent.
Still longer half the globe encumbers,
Still love . . . because they're fated to.
Still others sneered or turned malignant,
Still pleasanter is mute insistence
Still powdered is Lukrya Lvvna;
Still sleeps on furs at carriage door;
Still sniffling, coughing, hissing, clapping;
Still stir my heart at times to flight:
Stood by a river. Far away
Stood seared, as if by heaven's fire.
Straight out of life will crowd us too!
Straight scissors, curved ones, thirty sizes
Stretched out with death upon his brow,
(Strict judges, not to be derided),
Strike you up a rousing song, 
Subduing passion's host of troubles,
Sublime emotion's every feature,
'Sufficient for one winter's stay;
Surprised next morning when he found,
Survives when even tempests spin.
Sweet Lei* now floats above her head,
Sweet elegies, whose full collection
Sweet idleness! You have my heart.
Sweet talk with friends, on which I've fed.
Sweet thoughts of him in darkest night,
Sweet wilderness in which I spent
T
THE END
Take Tanya in and call her friend;
Takes in their ravishing deceits!
Takes on a film of ash and pales;
Takes up his pen. . . . His verses ring
Takes up his stand in indecision.
Take walks? The views give little reason,
Tatyana, O my dear Tatyana!
Tatyana and your Olga, pray? . . .
Tatyana, as her nurse suggested,
Tatyana blushed and trembled gently.
Tatyana bowed her head in shame,
Tatyana by the window lingers
Tatyana heard the news morosely
Tatyana heeded with conviction
Tatyana, in her low-cut gown,
Tatyana lies there nearly dead.
Tatyana listened to him preach.
Tatyana listened with vexation
Tatyana listens, scarcely hearing
Tatyana looks in melting pleasure
Tatyana looks with eyes unseeing
Tatyana murmured, at a loss;
Tatyana never joined their play
Tatyana . . . only her alone:
Tatyana pictures her Eugene,
Tatyana pined in isolation;
Tatyana's Letter to Onegin
Tatyana's charms and pallid air,
Tatyana screamed! He growled and reared,
Tatyana seeks some passage showing
Tatyana seemed among her kin
Tatyana's favourite. Now when sorrow
Tatyana's letter lies beside me,
Tatyana's love is deep and true:
'Tatyana's name-day celebration
Tatyana's scarce alive; Triquet,
Tatyana's soul. His true intention
Tatyana stopped in sudden dread
Tatyana thanks them for the day;
Tatyana, though, stayed calm and steady
Tatyana to our hero's side,
Tatyana tosses through the night
Tatyana tries to pay attention
Tatyana turns to say goodbye,
Tatyana waits: will he reply?
Tatyana walked, alone and dreaming,
Tatyana watches, fascinated,
Tatyana wept and mourned her lot. . .
Tatyana, whisp'ring in her ear:
Tatyana (with a Russian duty
Tatyana woke and, idly glancing,
Than all her friends in heaven's blue;
Than bearing all his pain unheard.
Than, down the sloping shoreline bounding,
Than he who brought the lady there
Than homes in which the wretched wife
Than our glum rhymesters of today?.. . .
That Cleopatra of the North;
That Freedom's Champion went astray.
That I'd have been the first to cheer!)
That I turn father, take a wife;
That Paris of the local towns,
That Tanya'd finally found a man;
That all of Russia scarcely numbers
That all our finest aspirations,
That angel. . . and proud fiend as well.
That any garret babbler hatches,
That any zealous vulgar phrase
That as it is my diction groans
That bachelors' lives were out of joint;
That child of ventures and finances,
That dangerous and sad pariah,
That death had opened wide its portals,
That dusky, linden-shaded walk
That endless chant the waves unfurled
That even now she pined and waited,
That everyone has heard his voice.
That figure standing mute and frozen,
That figure with the strange expression?
That, finding my ideal in you,
That foggy book they're all debating,
That former wastrel and disaster;
That friendly hands would surely rise
That friend of freedom ruled the scene,
That group in front; you see that pair . . .
That guests were soon to be expected;
That habit takes the place of bliss.
'That heavy general?' Tanya frowned.
That he'd found something else to do.
That he had wit and charm as well.
That held her heart, she knew not why)
That high and mighty Moscow knows.
That idle and reclusive schemer,
That idol whom ripe misses cheer,
That in their burning flow caress
That lady in the red beret?'
That lamp to which we've consecrated
That lie on maidens' bedside tables
That, like proud Byron, I have penned
That little girl whose warm esteem
That long ago she'd often heard
That made her sister's beauty sweeter
That marks his face? ... Is that Eugene? !
That miracles could still be wrought.
That momentary tender look,
That no reward on earth compares.
That no young girl thirteen,
That our good friend was only kind
That our young pilgrim leave at last.
That, panting, on a bench at last
That paying visits does me in;
That poor enamoured girl he'd known
That queen of secrets and of sighing.
That question you have put before:
That recluse from the world we know
That seared my Tanya's wounded heart!
That sees in sounds life's highest quest,
That semi-light, so pale and solemn,
That set Eugene and me apart.
That sets the aching heart atremble
That's fine of course, but all I've found
That's five and twenty cantos long!
That shaggy footman at her heels! . . .
That's not romanticism, surely;
That sometimes heavy, but good-hearted,
That sorceress the winter's here!
That sparkles, triumphs, and delights
That splendid view of distant domes,
That stranger no one seems to know?
That strikes him with such awful pleading?
That there exists a holy cluster
That they would even grow impatient
That we betrayed it every hour,
That wedding plans had long been set,
That wicked gossip with his flair
That with a secret exultation,
That work of heaven or of hell,
That wraps about the Yuletide night.
That your good friend won't find delightful,
The Corsair, or the Wandering Jew,
The Flemish painter's motley stuff!
The German baker's up and baking,
The Girls' Song
The Harlikvs were feeling mellow
The Hindu's herehis pearls to proffer,
The Kra's and Argva's banks*
The Larin girl.''You mean Tatyana!'
'The Larin place.''What reckless daring!
The Latin vogue today is waning,
The London social sets decry
'The Lord be with you now, my daughter!'
The Muse appeared as love was ending
The Muse first came to make me thrill.
The Muse then made them living creatures:
The Nereids'* eternal chorus
The North now howls, the winds are driving
The Russian winter passing by:
The Vampire with his pensive brow,
The ache of love pursues Tatyana; .
The actual things that make it thrive,
The aged ladies, decked in roses,
The age of hopes and tender yearnings,
The altar fire is out and done! . . .
The ancient Kremlin's hallowed keys.
The ancient coach creeps out the gate.
The ancient manse had been erected
The answer in his solemn leer.
The arms compressed and folded flat.
The aunts exchanged a wink and nodded,
The awesome blaze my Moscow wrought.
The awful word, so lightly uttered,
The badge on those two maids-in-waiting,*
The bailiff wrote as if on cue:
The balalaika's now my pleasure,
The balls go in each bevelled housing.
The balmy fragrance of the night!
The band of goblins, putting out
The bane of midnight sentry stations;
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,*
The bard, whose modesty's endearing,
The bathhouse table laid for two.
The beams from heaven's lanterns flash;
The bearded postboy sits as spotter.
The bear just followed where she led.
The bear proclaims: 'My gossip's in.'
The beauties in their filmy dresses,
The bee flies out from waxen cell
The bill to awesome stature grows.
The blood within this withered heart:
The blow has left poor Lensky shattered;
'The boredom, brother, there's the harm.'
The bosom friend she'd always cherished
The bottle pops as cork goes flying;
The brand new ballet's on in town!
The breathless night is warm and soft,
The breeder from the steppe as well
The brilliant madcap of confession.
The burbling brook, the wooded shade,
The busy master never took
The cabby plods to hackney row.
The call that brings them gathering round.
The caravan of cackling geese
The cattle low; and by the moon
The cavatina, heated sighs,
The cell in which he'd hibernated
The chairs, pushed back, give out a clatter;
The chance to know Onegin well.
The charming ladies twirl their feet
The charming line: 'belle Tatyan.'*
The charming sex is light as fluff.
The charm of gravely simple things,
The chasm's banks atop the ridge:
The chill of life with passing time;
The choice of books seemed strange indeed;
The clever husband chose correctly
The clink of glasses, shouts . . . confound her,
The clink of plates and forks increases,
The clock strikes ten: and off he's racing,
The clouds before them far and near:
The coaches and the people struggle,
The cock hails Vesper once again;
The cold sharp mind that he possessed;
'The colonel's sending it tonight.'
The comet wine* comes gushing out,
The company commander's here!
The conversation sparkled bright;
The cooks make lunch for one and all;
The corset, albums, chic relations,
The country, love, green fields and flowers,
The country place where my Eugene,
The countryside, poor village neighbours,
The course of youthful love's progression
The covenants of bygone races,
The covered sleigh, for years neglected,
The crafty husband fawned and chuckled
The crowd moves on to drawing room:
The crush, the glitter, and the gladness,
The cry resounds: 'Make way! Let's go!'
The cue's forgot, the billiards fade;
The cunning captive any day
The cunning of a base ambition
The curtain rustles as it soars.
The daring satirist Fonvizin,
The darkness wanes, but Tanya still
The darling sister whom she'd nourished,
The dawn arises cold and cheerless;
The day ahead all planned and taken:
The days flew by. The winter season
The days grew short and as they sped,
The day wore on, no word came flying.
The desk, the lamp that stands unlighted,
The devil take you, Uncle. Die!'
The die is cast: I'm in your power, 
The distant vault of heaven's hood;
The doors fly back; two figures enter
The double carriage lamps in rows
The doubts that plagued his heart and will;
The drawing room explodes with noise,
The drawing room had rich brocades
The dreadful harm of what he'd done.
The dread of vice, the fear of shame?
The driver sits behind the dash
The droning music never ceases;
The duellists shed their cloaks and wait.
The earth she walks, in splendour dressed!
The emptiness that plagues his soul
The empty fields in silence wait;
The endless dance had come to seem
The endless round, the varied game;
The evening samovar grew hot;
The ever dauntless hero stood
The faces one encounters daily,
The fall that year was in no hurry,
The falsehoods in reviews, the war,
The fame of Lovelaces has faded
The family's well, I think I'd say;
The fateful news, he'd been betrayed?
The fate that Tula clerk was dealt?
The featherbeds and coops of chickens,
The feet of ladies known before.
The fields all lay in misty peace;
The fields are dark now, what a shame.
The fields are silver where they froze . ..
The final hours come at last.
The fine and noble aspiration
The fire goes out; the coal, still gleaming,
The fire in both our hearts was pale;
The first four steps that lay ahead
The first sharp hammer clicks resound.
The first within me light no fires,
The fizzing wine comes gushing fast;
The flame within him would have died.
The fleeting works of my creation,
The flirt will always reason coldly;
The foes! How long has bloodlust parted
The foes stood by with eyes downcast.
The fools one never once forgets;
The foot of sweet Terpsichore.
The foreword's here, if overdue.
The friendly sun less often sparkled;
The frightful vision must foretell
The frigid, yawning days to be,
The frost already cracks and crunches;
The frost has gleamed, and we give thanks
The frozen corpse on sleigh, preparing
The frozen windows sparkling bright,
The fruits that learned science brought,
The furnishings were plain but stable:
The gambler's here with dice all loaded,
The game of billiards, all day through,
The gaping wound beneath his breast.
The garden lane, when straight ahead,
' The general verdict wasn't good.
The general with the prideful air.
The ghost of days beyond recall;
The giddiness of passion's sway?
The girlish hopes on which I fed,
The girls all jump and grow excited.
The girl's attentive eye embraces
The girls near Tanya; men delighted
The girl whose letter he still kept
The glasses jingle and resound.
The gleaming pistols wake from drowsing.
The glory of our days of old,
The glow of life has vanished starkly;
The goal of life, he found, was still
The god that makes this world go round!
The golden autumn now arriving.
The good old lady was delighted
The gowns, the talk, the milling mass,
The grave's eternal, fateful mystery,
The great Casino's opened up;
The great Rossini there to harken,
The greatest hall when it resounded,
The great finale's thunder surges.
The greedy horde demanding pay.
The grove's asleep above the river,
The grove, the hill, the field, the thicket
The grunting, loathesome bear still lumbers,
The guardsman clinks his spurs and dances,
The guests all bow and scrape their feet,
The guests all squeeze toward the centre,
The guests all stare in mute surprise;
The guests all treated so sincerely;
The hall is full of crowds and bustle;
The happiness for which I live.'
The haughty world would watch her closely
The heaped-up wagons now are readied;
The heap of books, the carpet spread
The hearth, the double panes shut tight
The heart no cause to beat the quicker;
The heart's dark secrets and traditions,
The hearts of even skilled coquettes!
The heart's reflections, writ in tears.
The heated words grow louder, quicken;
The heavens chose my destination 
The heavens sparkle now with blue;
The heavy silence grew protracted,
The hero in his work of fiction
The hero of my current tale:
The hero of our novel's action!
The hero's named, the plotting's done;
The holy days are here. What gladness! .. .
The horses neighed, their nostrils flaring,
The hostess artfully arranges
The hostess cries, 'At last you're here!'
The hostess kept the banter light
The hostess sees a lady coming,
The host of girls on marriage hunts
The hours of waking and of night
The household keys she always kept.
The hubbub grows more animated . . .
The humble sinner Dmitry Larin
The hunter hiding in the trees.
The ice-clad river's glassy lustre;
The intellect's cold observations,
Their albums too you must have seen,
Their charming words and glances sweet
Their chilly pride in high position,
Their daughters, after brief embraces,
Their daughters with this semi-Russian.
Their downy green and start to thicken.
Their elbows propped upon the table;
Their fathers, who were friends, had plans
Their festive dinner all too pleasing,
Their freedom for his honour's splendour;
Their girlish secrets of the heart
Their hopes, and pranks, and maiden dreams;
Their jealous torments, separation,
Their joy is striking men with fear,
Their laughing shouts and giddy joys.
Their natural virtue's flaunted banner;
Their natures distant and apart.
The iron bust* upon its column
Their pitchers in the stream and dally;
Their quartos to be signed by me,
Their rings are drawn in random order;
(Their sex, alas, is hard to sway).
Their talk's absurd, if harmless, cant.
Their tears of reconciliation;
Their tendency to just drop in
Their vigil and, embracing, wept.
Their youthful ravings and their blaze.
The jagged flints are set to go.
The jealous poet's mood turned festive!
The jesting praise, the pleading eyes .. .
The joy and hope of district mothers
The joyous tribe of boys berates
The kind of thought or observation
The ladies flocked to stand beside her;
The ladies' gowns so well designed;
The ladies to the hearth repair;
The lakeway path, the wood; and on
The landed gentwith daughters ripe,
The language of the gods she shed
The languid mind will find no spark,
The last (eighth) chapter of Eugene Onegin was published separately with the following foreword:
The latter, hard upon first greeting,
The less we love her when we woo her,
The letter she would send caressing
The letter's readyall but sent. . .
The letter trembles in her fingers;
The little girl with docile doll
The lofty Muses of his art;
The loge, where, beautiful and gleaming,
The long-awaited sail he sought?
The lover of Julie Wolmr,*
The loves and intrigues of the past,
The maid alone was left there standing
The maidens whisper by the stair;
The maids have gathered, one and all,
'The mail has kept him evidently.'
The manner grand can only bore.
The manor house, in proud seclusion,
'The man's a boor, he's off his rocker.'
The marker, half asleep, emerges
The marriage maker kept on calling
The masses of your mountains gleamed;
The mattresses, the trunks and chairs,
The men bowed lower when they spied her
The merchant's up, the pedlar scurries,
The merchant's youthful wife sits dreaming,
The merchant to the port advances,
The mix of years and ranks she sees.
The modern Russian's new disease.
The modish beauty's modish foe,
The molten wax submerge and turn
The moment one of them was sighted
The monde abhors a fickle heart.
The monde, the noisy ball forgot;
The moody fellow, still unchastened,
The moonlight shines upon her sill.
The more we draw a woman in,
'The morning star will gleam tomorrow,
The music's roar, the ballroom trembling,
The mysteries of its ancient past;
The mysteries of the marriage bed
The mystery that those pages told
Then Olga enters in confusion,
Then Olga pushes through the door,
Then Olga's suitor came a-wooing.
Then afterwards, as was his wont,
Then all the crowd comes pouring in
The name-day feast that's just begun.
Then asks her for the dance he's due.
Then beds are made; the guests are all
Then bowing to innate compassion,
Then bring in her guitar, excited . . .
Then broke into a coughing fit.
Then called his men and walked away.
Then crossed the girl and mumbled verse.
Then crowds its forebears toward the grave.
Then draws her to a corner gently
The neighbours shake their heads morosely
Then eighteen nags were led outside.
The next dance too. In God's creation!
Then feel her foot within my hand!
Then follows her about all day.
Then for a moment chatter ceases
Then from a basin filled with water
Then gave her spouse a look so tired,
Then gave it up and finally ended
Then gives her hand a gentle squeeze;
Then has the horses, on command,
'Then how'd you come to marry, nanny?'
The night before and what took place;
The night grew still. . . with silence falling;
The night has countless stars to light her,
The nightingale in darkest wood
The nightingale pours forth its tune.
The night-time lanterns all about;
Then in his babbling neighbour races,
Then knowthat were it in my power,
Then leads each man to where he'll stand,
Then lead them to the duelling site;
Then, leaning by the door, prepared
Then led the lady, safe, away.
The nobly born and fashion's pets;
The note was brief in its correctness,
Then others too must heed the call.
Then pushes straightway through the door
Then puts his couplet in her hands.
Then rage or drink. . . . Somehow proceeding,
Then read and readfrustration growing:
Then runs his fingers through his hair,
Then sadly saw the lovers go.
Then sang me to the churchyard gate.
'Then send your grandson, little Thomas,
Then spins and twists and stops to beat
Then spins her round before the guests;
Then stalk love fasterand entreat
Then stir my blood and fill my breast!
Then stretched a paw . . . sharp claws abhorrent,
Then sudden hoofbeats! . . . Now she's quaking. . . .
Then supper came, then time for bed,
Then, surely, none but you alone
Then swift as arrows raced for home.
Then this was certain sign to her
Then through his dressing room he'll pass
Then tossed about and seemed demented;
Then trading bows on every side
Then turned to see the books he'd favoured.
Then, wined and dined and heavy-hearted,
Then yawned and turned his head away:
Theocritus and Homer bored him,
The old Derzhvin* sawand blessed us,
The old corve and substituted
The old mazurka hasn't faltered;
The old was dated through and through,
The omission of certain stanzas has given rise on more than one occasion to criticism and jesting (no doubt most just and witty). The author candidly confesses that he has removed from his novel an entire chapter, in which Onegin's journey across Russia was described. It behoved him to indicate this omitted chapter by dots or a numeral, but to avoid ambiguity he thought it preferable to label as number eight, instead of nine, the final chapter of Eugene Onegin, and to sacrifice one of its closing stanzas:
The one she feared, the one she prized
The one-time corsair, Morali*
The one to whom, when face to face,
The one we sing to will be rich
The only clever thing he's done.
'The other. . .. But we'll talk tomorrow;
The other day, in rainy weather,
The pages of some dull review,
The panes chalked white. The owner's fled;
The peasant dance's drunken roar.
''The peasants there have hoards of treasure,
The people, yawning, in for prayer,
The pines in all their beauty frown
The pistol in his hand like lead,
The place Eugene found so confining
The plain inscription, skimming lightly;
The playful tune that keeps on drumming,
The poet, feasting on confession,
The poet, lost in hot contention,
The poet's gone . . . and hardly one
The poet's note about a 'meeting'.
The portly Mr. Pustyakv
The pranks and fun when first they'd met.
The prejudice that haunts all history,
The press intense, the hubbub loud;
The priests and guests left one by one.
The prima donna? The ballet?
The princess an impassioned letter.
The princess looked at himserene;
The princess sits alone in sight,
The princess, to his added tension,
The principles of Russian rhyme.
The printed verse had lain neglected
The quickly summoned, glistening tear!
The rascal froze his fingers, playing,
There Ozerov received the nation's
The regimental band's appearing!
There gleam the city gates already!
There is no path; the gorge that plummets,
There lies a spot the poet cherished:
There'll be a ball! What sheer delight!
There'll be a ball, a children's party;
'There'll be a crush and lots of babble
There's bear and blizzard, bridge, and crow,
There's no absurdity or worse,
There's no one else whom I'd adore; 
There's no one here to whom I've spoken, 
There's not a calumny too vile
There's nothing offers consolation
The restless gallery claps and roars;
The restless hero waiting there
There's wrath alone upon that face . . .
There too a tombstone can be found
There too, beneath the theatre's tent,
There too, within a shaded nook,
There was a time when I was keen,
There was a time when breezes playing
The rising vapours, faintly streaming,
The river gay and sparkling bright,
The roofs, the yard, the fenceall white;
The rooms of Olga and Tatyana
The room where fashion's model pupil
The rosy sealing wafer lingers
The rousing waltz goes whirling round.
The rutted snow had turned to slush;
The sacred dreams that fill your gaze,
The sacred ecstasy of art;
The salvaged streets will muster shoulders,
The same old patterns still are met:
The scarcely risen, newborn day.
The sceptic Bayle he quite devoured,
These clothes and faces with displeasure;
The second night, the snow fell late.
These creatures then would lure him back!
The secret refuge of the tomb. . . .
These days allotted me by fate . . 
These lines more quickly than the rest.
The sense and taste of ages past.
The sentimental verses too,
The servant maids would guess the fate
The servants fussed and raised the dickens
These stupid woods and fields and streams!
These words are hardly Russian stock;
The shapes of ladies' heads and feet.
The sheep of Kalmuk herdsmen stand,
The shepherd's pipe resounds and urges
The shrubs, the land ... all lie asleep,
The shutters open, smoke ascends
The sick old lady's kindly smile
The simple girl he'd known before,
The sky all lightly veiled and streaming.
The sky breathed autumn, turned and darkled;
The sleigh glides over ruts and passes
The sleighs, and rosy snow that shimmers
The sleigh's prepared; his pacing ceases;
The slightest hope that on occasion
The slow parade of guests who pass
The snow, his wife, and much, much more.
The social buzz became a bore,
The social cream had gathered gaily:
The social ritual never changes:
The solemn expert's learned air
The sombre men who form a frame
The sombre season near at hand;
The song they sang was from the past:
The sorry sight the fellow made.
The soul with endless youthful kisses,
The spleen is what the English call it,
The spring with which our honour's wound!
The squires face each other wheezing;
The stalls and pit are all ajitter;
The stanza fashioned by my lyre
The steaming blood poured forth, revealing
The still transparent woods renew
The stomach serves as clock for us;
The storm has blown; the lovely flower
The stout Moldavian prancing proudly;
The strangeness of his interference
The stylish rings the couple needed.
The sudden gust of wind surprises
The sum of all our hero's parts,
The swarming gallery throng that presses,
The tale that my Onegin knew ....
The tavern tribune and a liar
The theatre's full, the boxes glitter;
The thing he'd learned above all arts,
The things a simple girl would say,
The thirst for knowledge, work, and fame,
The time goes by and, as it goes,
The time of day by teas and dinners,
The time to quit the feast and fly,
The time will come without a doubt
The torment of a heart in flames,
The traveller's futile appetite;
The trees in winter silver dyed,
The trembling dreams the heart can hold.
The two Skotinins, grey as sages,
The two found everything a basis
The two friends' greetings pass unheard;
The two old ladies hugged and cried,
The uncut story of your fate.
The usual three-cart train will carry
The vales grow dry and colours quicken;
The very flower of French cuisine,
The very object of your song,
The very springtime of his days,
The very windows shook like Hades.
The vibrant voices, sits apart,
The view outdoorsthe lunar pall,
The villager to rise. It's morn!
The vision too of 'maiden free,'
The voice of lover, foe, and friend
The way lies open; war has passed
The ways in which a state progresses
The way the watchful servants stare,
'The way they did in former ages,
The way to master rampant grief;
The wayward fits, the final surges,
The wenches and the drivers brawl.
The whirling flash of pairs of feet,
The wilful swarm of hot desires.
'The will of God, I guess .... My Danny
The window boards have been inserted,
The winter road is smooth as ice.
The wives their jealous gossip spin.
The wolf appears with hungry mate;
The wood with mournful murmur shed
The works of Fontenelle he scoured;*
The world all fresh and white below.
The world for just a time forgot,
The world itself with magic power
The world's fresh glitter and its call
The world she loves and says goodbye:
The world with good, or earn at least
The wretched girl is scarcely breathing;
They all began to gossip slyly,
They asked him round and sought to match
They'd meet on horse each afternoon,
They dropped him cold and ceased to call.
They'd shed a tender tear or two
The years chase playful rhyme behind me,
The years to solemn prose incline me;
They find her stranger than expected,
They flap their wings and fly from shore.
They fluff her curls in latest fashion,
They glower coldly as they scheme
They hang pretentious menu pages,
They haunt my soul with dreams of strife.
They held all ancient customs dear;
They knew they'd settled that for good.
They laid to rest the dear departed;
They laughed. Then guests began arriving.
They'll welcome us with great delight.'
They made the barking hounds obey,
They needed kvas no less than air,
The youngbloods' yarns of courting death.
The young man's blissful, brief infection;
The young pursued my Muse like devils;
The youthful lover of the dance
The youthful lover's voice is stilled,
The youthful lover with his yen
The youthful poet's friend and slayer?'
They passed the garden's dark recesses,
They reach the mill. He bids Guillot
They're all aboard and, slowly gliding,
They're closer . . . coming here . . . it's he!
They're hardly worth the songs one sings
They're harnessed to the coach and steadied;
They're leaving for the duelling place,
They're people whom we're bound to prize,
They rode for seven days and nights.
They say you like to be alone 
They seem so pallid and so weary,
They seem to go before they're here!
They send you greetings and affection. . . .
They sit. Eugene can only stare,
They sit in Olga's room together;
They spade up silver from a ditch!
They squeeze her hand and, in the end,
They steal away whenever able
They still assail a soul grown cold
They stir our hearts and fan the flame.
They take her to the Grand Assembly:*
They took offence and, one and all,
They've passed away or changed unbidden ...
They've shifted round and been reseated;
They've vacancies galore . . . take heart!'
They whisper: 'Dunya, don't look bored!'
This Grandison was fashion's pet,
This careless gift for waxing tender,
This child of comfort and of glamour,
This distant goddess so transcendent,
This dreadful ailment's heavy toll;
This fickel swain of every star,
This fragile life that hurries so!
This generation's younger beauties,
This heart still throbbed with inspiration;
This hollow world has learned to shun!
This homage that the great world tenders,
This might well seem an indiscretion,
This most unpleasant tte--tte;
This night will pass (the next one too),
This noble and profound creation
This note's to him.''Now don't get riled,
This placid lady, he detected
This raving discourse of the heart
This swirling swamp in which we lie
This tattered life of masquerading,
This tiring trek through town extended
This touching whimsy free of art,
'This was a poet, yes indeed!'
This weary tinselled life of mine,
This world of glitter, fumes, and noise,
Those desert wastes and waves inspired,
(Those dreams and harmonies I tend)
Those figures fancy has created
Those heady walks for which you're thirsting,
Those journals where each modern Moses
Those joyous hopes that bloomed so brightly
Those kin who've come from distant places
Those massive cliffs and pounding sea,
Those mighty years still rich in fame. . .
Those objects of your verse . . . and more,
Those rushing tides in tumult tumbling
Those springtime days in secret valleys,
Those twelfthtide eves, by old tradition,
Those words with whichbefore the feet
Thou bard of Finland's maid divine!*
Though here and there much labour lately
Though he's unknown and lives obscurely,
Though not without a heartfelt sigh,
Though now and then some gossip gleams.
Though on the whole he saw no sense
Though pleased with the revenge he'd taken,
Though why they do, I hardly know).
Three bottles daily from Vry's.*
Three pairs of shapely feet. .. And yet,
Through Albion's great and haughty lyre*
Through all her years since cradle days,
Through drawing rooms he'd pass and stare;
Through empty hall; then passes, gliding,
Through force of passion and of sense,
Through grand salon. And on! ... All bare.
Through greening fields, and watch it dally
Through marble entry rushes straightway,
Throughout our native Russian ground.
Throughout that barren, dim dominion
Throughout the house the ceilings towered,
Through ranks of men from highborn classes,
Through silent woods and so discovers
Through which he entered, newly crowned.
Thus bees from luscious hive will scatter,
Thus does our age its sins redress!
Thus heaven's gift to us is this:
Thus heaven wills the world to turn.
Thus peopleso it seems to me
Thus, slowly, down a sloping rise,
Thus spake Eugene his admonition.
Thus storms in autumn, blowing colder,
Thus stormy shadows cloak with grey
* Thus you, Yazykov,* with perfection,
Till father blessed me and gave in.
(Till on the fields, spring rains have passed)
Time was, when cold debauch was lauded
Time was, when flunkies in high places
Time was, with grave and measured diction,
Tir d'une lettre particulire*
To French. . . . There's nothing I can do!
To Lovelace Grandison, but merely
To Moscow and the marriage mart!
To Olga, he would whisper low:
To Olga like some dreadful dream.
To Tanya, Lensky; Harlikva,
To Tanya, who could barely stand;
To aim at temple or at thigh.
To all her foreign affectations,
To all her groves and meadows, yearning
To all my youthful verses tender,
To all these letters and these tears.
To all this gossip; but it's true
To answer her. His mind supplies
To arm my gaze and speech with lies:
To be respected in this life;
To be the first who thus shall honour
To bid their mistresses farewell.
To bind with family ties my life;
To bring Lepage's deadly pieces;*
To bring two centuries to blows.
To bud anew each vernal season.
To burnand with the mind each minute,
To calm the tremor in her heart
To calm the tumult in one's heart;
To catch your smile and search your gaze
To cheer the dark imagination
To circles that you find more swank;
To claim its meed from field and dell.
To classicism I've been true:
To close one eye and, only then,
To conquer youthful virtue's meekness
To crush a rivaloh, what nets,
To dazzle, conquer . . . and to fly.
To decent folk for days and days,
To do what helpless horses can't.
To drive the body home once more.
To drive the cows outside with ringing;
To eat the master's fruit when hidden,
To exercise restraint and reason,
To face them; and amid the din,
To fad and fashion newly mated:
To faint; but deep within her, will
To fall about her feet like slaves!
To fall asleep at home serenely;
To fall like stars upon the ground.
To family dinners just to share
To feed the critics' hungry pen.
To fevered rhyme: for thus he doubles
To find Anisya and to plunder
To find an adequate translation
To find herself at his estate. .. .
To find the stuff is heavy sport.. .
To fluff the pillows for his head,
To forest green and liberation,
To former ways I'll still be true.
To glance behind her; on she pushes
To glimpse the Larins' brand new neighbour;
To gloss a common epigraph,
To greet an entrechat with cheers,
To halt just there her panting steed;
To have his couplet heard at last,
To have the family, that's all, friend;
To hear such sensible advice;
To hear the sea's incessant sound,
To hear what I'm prepared to say
To hear your voice. . . to try to capture
To help her with her shawl or furs,
To help the rural day go by?
To help those pies and beefsteaks settle,
To his estate, where first she cried
To hiss at Phdreso unsteady,
To honour, love, and idolize,
To hug her parentseither one;
To humble prose I'll bend my lyre:
To inundate the fields below.
To join her life to his career,
To join his forebears any day;
To join the crowd, where each is ready
To joke and comment (rather wryly);
To judge the wit with which I lie.
To keep her fury in control!
To keep his wicked tongue in check,
To keep sly mouths from feeling free
To keep your daughters well in sight;
To laugh a bit at something new;
To learn the news: has heaven brought
To leave the city with its flurry,
To lend a hand to help her cross.
To lift her skirt with trembling finger;
To light the sombre sky and shatter
To live amid the common tide;
To live he hurries and to feel makes haste. Prince Vjazemsky
To long to clasp in adoration
To look at life as at a rite,
To lose my hateful freedom then.
To love all ages yield surrender;
To lull black empty thoughts awhile;
To make love's value all the greater
To make the foreign tour we'd planned;
To mar the fleeting page with verse;
'To me, Onegin, all these splendours,
To meet a black-robed monk by error,
To melt with pain before your face,
To mend my ways in deeds and diction,
To mock in such a casual fashion
To monstrous looks and hellish squealing
Tomorrow too will be the same.
To murmur lies in aged ears.
To my old nurse, my childhood's friend;
Too deaf and still to make reply
'Too late,' he thought, 'the moment's wasted. . . .
To overcome those predilections
To paint a Petersburg grand ball;
To part the footmen who surround her
To pat the old man's laurelled head!
To plead her elder sister's cause.
To pledge my token to your name
To put a bullet through his head,
To quite forget us, if they please
To read in Russian. Dread command!
To read one day their marriage banns.
To read their works before the glances
To read to her for whom you long:
To reappear at his estate
To render service, give relief;
Tormented now by deep regret,
To rowdy feasts and altercations
To rule the house as autocrat,
To say that he was quite prepared. 
To see how he may wane or flourish,
To see that flirt before the duel.
To see the day!" ' ... In lamentation,
To see the empty house again;
To see the vacant house alone
To see you and pursue you madly!
To servants' quarters. Rest is needed
To serve sweet bondage with his arms.
To shake their heads, to prate and prattle,
To share a quiet evening's end.
To share my baneful, sad existence,
To share with all the world her beauty,
To shatter slander's cup of lies;
To shed a tear in desolation
To shout as one: 'She's mine! She's mine!'
To show my Muse a grand soire;
To show their gall. . . and waistcoats too,
To show them in their isolation,
To sigh, deceive, and play his part
To sigh for sombre Russia's spaces,
To sing the savage steppe,* elated;
To sit and watch the grand procession
To sizing up a lavish pie*
To social scandal's kind of fame?
To some soire . . . and by the door,
To spare his charge excessive pain,
To speak in singsong intonations,
To spread their grudging shade a bit.
To spy on Tanya down below
To stay with us and seemed transported;
To stroll about at total leisure,
To strut their stuff and thunder by,
To swim upon the water's breast;
To swoon and pass away . . . what rapture!
To take his aim. . . . And that was when
To take his grieving bride directly
To take my rest from yesterday.
To take some tea while Dunya poured;
To take this note of mine to #62038;------,
To talk once more and say goodbye.
To talk to them of clothes or fashion
To tell you all in full detail.
To tell you how this meeting went
To tend a sick man night and day,
To tender novels she retreats,
To the circle of our dance.
To thirst with love in every part,
To this offensive show of passion,
To those with lavish whims and coffers,
To thread a needle, wouldn't linger
To touch a torrid hand to hers,
To trumpet, mask, and dagger* too,
To turn at last to lifeless stone
To visit come the Christmas feast,
To wander by the lonely lake
Towards the sea I'd make my way.
To wash those sizzling cutlets down;
To waste itself in empty schemes.
To watch the brilliant ballroom spin.
To where the leafy woodlands rustle
To where the prostrate princess lay;
To which Eugene paid special heed,
To which he yielded one by one,
To whisper hope and sweet delight?
'To whom? How long?''Some two years since . . .
To whom amid the jealous throng
To whom will all our faults be few?
To wondrous shapes which designated
To you, I'm sure, was trite and old.
To your repeated, desperate cry?
Treats Europe's dainty artefacts
Triquet stands up; the congregation
True Gaul, Triquet in pocket carried
True lovers of a funeral feast.
Tsimlynsky wine ... a whole array
Tumultuous, fond recollections,
Turned south; and all around there hovered
Turn meadows into marshy ground
Turns curious to see still more
'Twas dusk; and on the table, gleaming,
'Twas evening and the heavens darkled.
'Twas only habit then that taught her
'Twas this our hero had contracted;
Twice yearly too they did their fasting;
Two Petriads,* a grammar book,
Two hearts, perhaps, remain forlorn
Two maidens used to come with flowers,
Two minutes barely has she sat. . .
Two pine trees grow there, roots entwined;
Two slender, icebound poles lie linking
Two soldier husbands and a war.
Two special feet. And in my slumbers
Twould make an epigram of style.* .
Unbidden guests for their intrusion;
Unbidden tears and its ovations,
Unchanged when even years have passed.
Undressed, by candle he selected
Unfaithful women he had known,
Unfit for maiden's heart or head),
Unlike those merchants filled with cares,
Unluckily, Dame Larin wasted
Unmetred lines of hallowed usage
Unmindful too of town or friends
Unmoved to count beneath the sun
Unsealed your heart to me so clearly?
Unseen by bee or butterfly.
Unsmiling faces on display;
Until Brguet's* unsleeping chime
Until Triquet, who had a knack
Until at last her fate was granted:
Until at last her strength is gone.
Until at last she whispered low: '
Until at last the husband found
Until he had no means for more.
Until his valet brings his tray.
Unwillingly within the mirror,
Up chimney flue. The sparkling glasses
Up in that stupid sky you honour.'
Upon a bough above that urn;
Upon a deuce, that cunning bait.
Upon her balcony appearing,
Upon her fevered tongue and dries.
Upon his neighbour's place of sleeping,
Upon my trail, three years belated,
Upon our mournful northern snow.
Upon the ballroom's mirrored floor,
Upon the crossroads of the sea?
Upon the first page you'll discover:
Upon their buttercups of rue.
Upon the lady whose expression
Upon the letter that she wrote.
Upon the modish word 'ideal'
Upon the moon to bring it nearer;*
Upon the porch, with broom in hand,
Upon the square the crowd emerges,
Upon the stage still romp and roar,
Upon the table after play,
Upon those feet these lips . . . caressing.
Use flattery as warm incentive,
Vague threats and rumours, premonitions;
Vexation? Pride? Or youth's old yen
Vivacious, brilliant. . . and too light.
'Vladimir Lensky lies below.
Vladimir Lnsky, just returning
Vladimir gave a curt reply
Vladimir gave his heart and waited
Vladimir gently dozed for real;
Vladimir hasn't heart to mention
Vladimir's stormy soul grew wings;
Vladimir vowed he wouldn't run
Vladimir waited near the dam;
Warmed by the god of inspiration,
Was I like that when I was tender,
Was I so racked with yearning's anguish:
Was all that Olga, smiling, said.
Was at the time in full devoted
Was born beside the Neva's span,
Was born to play this very part.
Was carping at the millstone's cam.
Was given us in vain, to burn;
Was in his primea handsome youth
Was it not you who seemed to hover
Was like a blow. Onegin shuddered,
Was love itself, the art of ardour,
Was quite a lovely country nest,
Was quite the pedant in his dress
Was sleeping soundly even then.
Was this that girl... or did he dream?
Was this the Tanya he once scolded
Was wondrous tender. If asserting
Was younger still than me, my dear,
We all take on Napoleon's features,
We call it simply Russian soul. 
We'd never heard of love, you see.
We drank in silent contemplation
We heed the rustling wood's resurgence,
We lack, I know, a worldly tone, 
'Well, I despise your upper classes
'Well, I won't keep you, have no worry,
Well, almost all that they possessed.
We'll dig bold tunnels 'neath the deep
Well, here's my view of close relations:
We'll not have Tanya conjure so.
Well-off. . . and handsome in addition,
Well, she's just promised his good friend
We'll show your Tanya.
Well, tell me: what would you . . . inside
'Well then, come on . . . we'll go and meet her.'
Well, this was my Eugene's conclusion.
Well, thus am I. And was it merely
'Well, what about it? Lord, it's ages. . .
'Well, where's the harm ... the evening passes.'
We'll whip his heart, and when it's tame . . .
Were bound for home. Still waters sparkled.
Were fond of songs for fortune-casting,
Were just as dull as city highways;
Were marked at home on their estate:
Were my Onegin's saintly pleasures,
We're now no longer fit to write
Were objects of his thought no more.
We're put to sleep by talk of 'sin';
Were quite forgot; she bid adieu
Were sure to bring a mocking gaze
Were these the thoughts that crossed my mind
Were you in love then, long ago?'
Were your good friend before you now,
(We say 'romantically'although,
We sometimes like to listen then
We still, alas, cannot forestall it
Wet nurses shout and babies bleat.
We've all received an education
We've got to have forbidden fruit,
We've roamed the world down one slim lane
What? Invitations? Yes, three houses
'What ails you, Tanya?''Life's so trifling,
What aims . . . what hopes do 
What answer came? Just stern rejection.
What a sorrow
'What can I do? Tatyana's grown,'
What casual letters he would send her!
What clever traps he'd set before him!
What clues the index can afford her:
What din, debates! The good Automne*
What dreams of hers were re-enacted?
What evening holds or where he'll go.
Whatever Paris, seeking treasure,
Whatever clever London offers
Whatever comes to his attention
Whatever feelings then lay hidden
Whatever, reader, your reaction,
What fate will morning bring my lyre?
What fiery art his speech revealed!
What from his prime had been his pleasure,
What hitter scorn and condemnation 
What household goods are necessary:
What is itmartyred pride, or spleen
What languor fills her lovely breast!
What languor when his lips were sealed,
What mad and magic yearnings tore me
What more can I in candour say? 
What more, my friends, could you demand?
What news of oysters? Here? What rapture!
What occupied, the livelong day,
What odes indeed he might have written,
What passions in my soul awoke!
What prosy ravings strung together,
What role does he intend to fill?
What roses Hymen means to send
What secret message she'd been sent,
What's given to us ever palls,
What's made that frigid soul excited?
What's more: poor guiltless Lensky perished,
What's more, that duelling fox has tasted
What's more, the husband's frank opinion
What sombre echoes of ambition
What's stirring in that idle gaze,
What's that? Just that. Mere conversation
What's that... the crunching snow . . . who's coming?!
What's this he hears? Could she intend? . . .
'What's wrong?' She peered at him, intent.
What's wrong with him? . . . He's in a daze.
What tender and oppressive yearning
What vernal flowers do you tread?
What wars and famines have occurred?
What was he then? An imitation?
What wicked and deserved derision 
What wings our first successes gave!
What wintry frost surrounds her now!
When I recall how you reacted:
When Tanya's ring turned up at last,
When all agree and have long since;
When all at once far-off I've sighted
When basic products it possesses.
When by the hearth he'd sit alone
When captured by some boy in spring;
When cherished beings filled my dreams.
When dancing stars are disappearing
When earth's horizon softly blushes,
Whenever dazzling ladies proffer
Whenever nanny brought together
When, filled once more with inspiration,
When first I met you and detected
When headlong and alone on horse
When he'd arrived, and if of late
When he drives home, she still engages
When he, in flaming verse, portrays
When in a frenzied state indeed
When in some quiet rural place
When in that silent room appeared
When in the parlour guests converse;
When it has yet to fully flower.'
When just the master's least suggestion. . . .'
When men of reason and good humour
When midnight sky is limpid-light
When mid the guests she recognized
When, 'neath your endless chant I pined
When off beside my lake I climb
When one becomes the butt of rumour,
When one fine day our grandsons true
When one gets old, life turns oppressive.'
When only bareness greets the eye.
When our old roads' decayed condition
When passion's flame no longer rages,
When scarce a boy and not yet knowing
When self-expression gripped his friend;
When she was small she didn't choose
When some good neighbour drops in weary
When some new demon seizes me;
When suddenly far off it sees
When suddenly from ballroom doorway
When wayward fate has made me stray
When we at last turn into sages
When we have broadened education,
When we lure the fellow on, 
When we play our maiden games!'
When we see him from afar, 
When we sing our secret songs,
When you came in, I seemed to waken, 
When you, with so much strength of mind,
Where I'm so much abused today,
Where Lensky with his pawn once took,
Where all breathes Europe to the senses,
Where all was shown ... all unprotected?
Where are you? Come! I bow to you
Whereas the ode has aims sublime.
Where commerce, bustling, crowds and presses
Where dawn's vermilion rays are playing;
Where every day before his eyes
Where fate once willed our confrontation,
Where fingernails had sharply pressed;
Where first I loved, where first I wept,
Where first, Onegin, I saw you;
Where first our novel's plot unfolded?
Where girlfriends scribble hopes and blisses
Where he and Tanya had their talk.
Where he and she once had their talk.
Where hills half circle round a valley,
Where is it better, then?'
Where is your equal to be found!
Where just Terpsichore enchants
Where lowly nature is enacted
'Where master used to sit alone.
Where maybe, reader, you began,
Where no one raised the slightest fuss:
Where now the ardent agitation,
Where once our hero used to dwell.
Where one who favoured soft reclining
Where only his sad trace remains.
Where over my poor nanny now
Where she sits waiting . . . waiting still!
Where skies for endless days are clear,
Where swans call out and beauty dallies,
Where sweet Thalia calmly dozes,
Where two expectant merchants stand.
Where two old friends in conversation
'Where we are not.'
Where will he dash to, my good hearty?
Where will he make the night's first call?
Where you spent wintertime in play;
Which Lensky, blushing, leaves unread. . . .
Which Ovid sang in ages past,
Which is to say that he could tell
Which just-delivered importations
Which made poor Olga feel bereft.
Which meant a longer trip of course;
Which might in turn bring you some claim
Which seems a touch absurd today!
(Which we, of course, in him should praise).
Which wines have come without delay?
Which young Semynova did share;
While Fate intends no grand conclusion. . . .
While I, mid friends, was drunk with pride
While I, perhaps, descend in sorrow
While I roar out the light refrains.
While Iso long ago it seems!
While Lensky rages at the sight.
While Morpheus still roamed in flight;
While Petersburg, already rousing,
While all those cupids, devils, serpents
While everywhere before your eyes
While far away some rousing song
While he plays horse and runs ahead;
While high above the moon's aloft,
While in his mind Imagination
While in the back her husband dozes,
While in the yard their men reproach
While life was still but in its morn
While muffled by the violin
While near at hand, all dense and shaded,
While 'neath her downy pillow lying,
While never meaning to be spiteful;
While next to Limburg's lively mould
While none held head and shoulders higher
While nothing new was in the new;
While on the flames he'd drop unseen
While on the floor Triquet's at rest
While on the last one you'll uncover:
While past its glassed-in windows flitter
While picking berries, filled the air
While some rude Cyclops at his fire
While spinning round in bright red hat;
While taking leave, Tatyana hovered
While thinking under every sigh:
While thoughts of money filled his head.
While through the glass his mother scowls.
While travelling near that selfsame sea,
While we, the foes of Hymen's banner,
While women wept and doctors frowned.
While yet a foreign language slips
Whist's heroes have by now completed
Who cooled off love with separation
Who'd ask for more? The world could tell
Who'd dare to seek the tender maiden
Who'd dreamt and loved, was born once more.
Who'd killed his friend for satisfaction,
Who doesn't find dissembling dreary;
Who gained in turn, without regrets,
Who hates all gestures, each warm word,
Who haunts your thoughts and writer's quill,
Who in an aimless, idle fix
'Who is she, though?' 'My wife, old boy.'
Who joked both cleverly and wryly
Who late at night are whisked away
Who learned to bear, without surrender,
Who'll coddle us and never doubt us?
Who'll never bore us through and through?
'Who loves you more than I must sign
Who never drained life's chalice dry,
Who never knew exotic visions,
Who never risked his sound estate
Who plays an unwed father's role,
Who rests within the heart's sweet places
Who ruled the queenly Neva's shore.
Who's cross with everything about:
Whose author's powers of depiction
Whose cordial hand shall then be led
Whose form, in pensive adoration,
'Whose gaze, evoking inspiration,
Whose head is never fancy-stirred,
Whose heart.. . experience has cooled
Whose peasants lead a wretched life;
Whose potent light in all its lustre
Whose turbid streams flow down and cluster
Who's standing there in conversation
Who takes cold intellect for naught,
Who taught her then this soft surrender,
Who turns each morning into night.
Who was at twenty fop or swell,
Who was it you were dreaming of?'
Who won't betray us in the end?
Who won't sow slander all about us?
'Who would have thought?' 'How long it's been!'
Who wouldn't grow fatigued with rages,
Who yawned with wife and friends, exempt
Why, I can picture theminspired,
Why I've seen ladies so complacent
'Why all these yawns, Onegin? Really!'
Why argue vainly with the season?
Why did you ever come to call?
'Why did you leave last night so early?'
'Why here he is: Monsieur Guillot,
Why mark me out for your attention?
Why murmur vainly? He can't give
'Why, my dear lady, what's the bother?
Why, my good husband's sainted mother
Why no one, friends, as God's my witness,
Why not? I like its intonation;
'Why not?''Were I the poet, brother,
'Why not at all.''Well, serves you right;
'Why not at all, they just intend
Why, pretty one, you're up already!
'Why, she who with a wistful air
Why spend your efforts all in vain;
'Why, sweetheart, anything you choose.'
Will be quite pleased to greet, I know;
Will change beyond all recognition.
Will claim what happy days remain.
Will cross our Russia far and wide;
Will draw her leather reins up tightly
Will drown my memory's brief existence;
Will earn me an indulgent gaze,
Will freedom comeand cut my tether?
Will on some future day relate
Will point my portrait out and plead:
Will strain to hear with bated breath
Will stride in broadly arching sweep;
Will you at last cut memory's thread?
(With God knows whom on every side),
With Olgaall confused and shook
With Russian pancakes, Russian cheer;
With Tanya's aunt, a kind relation
With all her marble beauty's fire
With all my love, till death us parts; 
With all my soul your perfect grace;
With all of life before it yet
With all the nonsense lovers sing;
With all the surgings of your heart,
With apprehensive step . . . then fled!
With banal ladies, men who shout,
With bark of pugs and maidens' joys,
With carefree charm and winsome air
With children of all shapes and ages
With choral songas they'd been bidden
With conscience as his judge of right,
With dawn's first rays Tatyana races
With decks of cards of every type,
With drooping head and frequent yawning,
With epigrams of spite and daring
With evening's gloom, the day has set. . .
With every tribute he can find:
With far too many foreign loans;
With fiery praise . . . and heated sighs;
With flashes of his sudden wit!
With folded arms, along the hall,
With gaze of keen commiseration
With golden crosses, ember-bright.
With grammar may delight us all,
With grandams and granduncles gaily
With her old friend. 'My little dove,
With him amid the frosty gloom.
With his Ochkov decoration!*
With his enraptured poet's pen
With his immoral soul disclosed,
With humble roots and servants' hall;
Within a book her heart's extremes,
Within a cool and leafy nook.
Within a dream to which we cling,
Within five hundred years about),
Within her heart the frenzied beating
Within his soul must hold men small;
Within me now they are no more:
Within my soul will fade and dwindle:
Within the witching webs we spin.
Within this breast no longer young;
Within this strange new domicile
Within those empty halls ornate,
Within those waves each martyred soul
With joy his heart anticipated
With jug in hand the milkmaid hurries,
With just a dash of lemon flavour.
With just two balls and blunted cue.
With kindly neighbours sometimes present
With laughter, kisses, din and hustle;
With lots of jam and talk to spare.
With loving eyes that seek you gladly;
With meaning for our Russian hearts!
With men he knew or friends he spied,
With mighty Russian hammer whacks,
With misty eyes he looks on sweetly
With mournful air and brooding glance,
With nasty gossip or a jest. . . .
With native glibness from their lips?
With negligent lorgnettes in view.
With no great palaces, no streets,
With no great sense of deprivation;
With no reply. He drives, dejected,
With notes that run to seven pages,
With nothing that it must regret,
With olden days beyond recall,
(With other capers such as courting)
With our Zaretsky at a distance
Without a doubt a full translation
Without a foreword's interference,
Without a word the lady shuns him!
Without position, work, or wife
Without response and takes no part;
Without surprise or indignation.
Without them my Onegin's fashioned.
With passion's game we both were sated;
With pictures of a happy pair;
With quiet, firm, and measured tread,
With rules, traditions, ancient ways
With secret meanings they'd impart;
With shouts of joy and welcome cheer.
With shouts of joy on either side.
With sighs of passion and with praise.
With silence and in meditation:
With sinless dreams of sweet delight.
With slippers and a dressing jacket,
With sock in hand he led the way
With something of his true complexion
With sparkling wine for us to savour.
With spellings awesome in abusage,
With spring he felt rejuvenated:
With stern behaviour's grim attack,
With stillness, stars, the lonely night,
With such a lively mind and will,
With such a rashness in surrender,
With sweetly flaming love's refrain,
With tea too sweet to be inviting,
With tenderness and pain imbued,
With tender soul and manly grace,
With those who'd known the now deceased;
With throbbing head about to split:
With us the word's an innovation,
With vain pursuit of worldly ends;
With verse in hand, looks Tanya's way
With visions of some distant place,
With watchful mothers, aunts who stare,
With what a tempest of desire!
With what a vivid fascination
With what celestial pride she grazes
With what delight I praise those hours
(With which my novel took its start);
(With whom today we're rather bored)
With wicked grin or solemn eye
With winter's brilliant rug of snow
'Won't call me "sir" the way he should.
Won't kiss a lady's hand, the mocker.'
Won't let the traveller sleep at all.
Would be the bride I'd make my own.
Would call Praskvya 'chre Pauline'.
Would chase sweet vanity again.
Would dine with him in winter here.
Would fail to touch my heart at all,
Would hear the bailiff, give his orders,
Would just have been the death of me!'
Would light the way with secret stories!
Would like to bid his heir adieu.
Would listen gravely to the end
Would listen with a look intense,
Would mend life's thread and make it whole;
Would muse on passions* and their flights.
Would oft recite, his eyes ablaze,
Would one day shine upon our race
Would praise him for his nasty grit:
Would stop her now for no good reason
Would take my merry Muse along
Would thank his stars to be so blest.
Would touch obliquely on the point
Would whisper it her secret prayer.
Write odes,* good sirs, write odes, I say . . .
Yes, he was loved .. . beyond deceiving . . .
Yes, soon he lost all warmth of feeling:
Yet I in futile dullness squander 
Yet distant hopes within me dreaming
Yet even in these same afflictions
Yet in its mirror not reflecting
Yet neither Virgil's, nor Racine's,
Yet not replaced you after all?
Yet once he'd moved her heart to tears!
Yet still Onegin slumbers deeply.
Yet wasn't, like so many, blind;
Yet were not morals ill affected
You came to me in nuptial splendour;
You cannot know: I'm so alone, 
You cherished dreams of sacred worth
You dropped in twice and closed the book;
You'd start to weep, but all your crying
You epicures and sages, you;
You filled my dreams and sweetest trances; 
You fledglings from our Lyvshin's crew,*
You fortunate procrastinators,
You futile, searching phantom-breeder,
You gorgeous albums stamped with gilt,
You had no use for my devotion . . .
'You have been out of circulation.
'You know him then?' 'Well, yes and no.'
You know these days I'm not so clear,
You learn life's sweetness . . . feel its kiss,
You left no prints, no pressings tender,
You libraries of darkest Hades
You'll be my guardian till the end. . . .
You'll fall in love again; but learn . . .
You'll meet the haughty Slav, the Greek,
You'll never guess . . . it's water-short!
You'll read, no doubt, fond protestations:
You loved instead to come and go
You lover of the Muse's art, #62038;
You may have sought in these reflections
You mourn the poet, friends . . . and rightly:
'You mustn't think . . . and please don't worry . . .
Young Lensky came to cast an eye
Young Lensky seemed the perfect catch;
Young Olga's friends to spend the day,
Young Tanya, my enchanted dreamer;
Young life's own whirlwind, full of sound,
Young maidens find quick consolation
Young maidens hushed in passing by her;
You ought to, really . . . they'll be flattered;
You pitied then my girlish dreams. . . .
You poets who have sinned unduly:
Your Grandison?' 'I never knew . . .
Your Olga's look is cold and dead,
Your candour has a great appeal
Your cheeks are poppies now, my pet.'
Your claim upon its joyous duties
You're burning up!''Oh, do be still,
You're just not well, you're overheated.'
'Your elegy lacks all perception,
You're like a comrade, ever steady,
'You're married! Really?''On my honour.'
Your endless croakings and gyrations
You're now subdued, you vaulting schemes
You're right. And will you point with praises
You're still my little early bird!
You're sure to find there decorations:
Your fateful tempter's figure lies.
Your frigid glance . . . that sermonette! . . .
Your genius for a worthy end:
Your haughty glance may well express!
Your interest piqued and doubtless growing
Your knees . . . and, sobbing at your feet,
Your mount, if put to try his paces
Your noble thoughts and simple ways.
Your solemn gaze may only spy
Your tears and rhymes and what-you-will?
Your tears in fact would only gall.
Your trusting soul. . . and sweet devotion.
You rustic Priams from the cities,
Your valleys, woods, and hamlets seemed
Your verse's limpid, live complexion,
Your virtues are a vain temptation,
Your voice within my soul rang clear. . . . 
You stayed his friends despite all this:
You stirred me with your wondrous glances,
You too have known such belles before.
You too, indulgent reader, hurry
You too, you mamas, I commend you
You too, young mistresses of leisure,
You've been invited there next week!'
You've found at least a crumb or two.
You've guessed already. Yes, indeed:
You've now resigned to him your fate.
You've paid your due to follies past.
You volumes nimbly ornamented
You were the first that he forswore;
You won't abandon me, I know. 
You won't be pleased to see it done.
'You wrote to me. Do not deny it.
' Zaretsky bit his lip, well vexed.
Zaretsky, carefully, then lay
Zaretsky favoured stout reliance
Zaretsky frowned in consternation:
Zaretsky had again called round;
Zaretsky paces off their fate
Zaretsky, pleading much to do,
Zartskyonce a rowdy clown,
Zhukovsky
and plaits his simple shoes of bast.
