APPENDIX
EXCERPTS FROM ONEGIN'S JOURNEY
And cattle wand'ring o'er the lea;
Upon the crossroads of the sea?
While travelling near that selfsame sea,
Those massive cliffs and pounding sea,
May yet not drown in Lethe's sea;
Illumined sadly by Diana,
All sad and silent like Svetlana*
Oh, never know these frightful dreams, My dear Svetlana!
And I, recalling poor Svetlana,*
But then sheer terror seized Tatyana ...
The rooms of Olga and Tatyana
Her sister bore the name Tatyana.
The Larin girl.''You mean Tatyana!'
Onegin's Letter to Tatyana
Tatyana, O my dear Tatyana!
'But tell me, which one was Tatyana?'
The ache of love pursues Tatyana; .
And boldly put for 'belle Nina'
As in some dull, Van Dyck madonna;
A liar still, Lyubv Petrvna;
Still powdered is Lukrya Lvvna;
'Princesse, mon ange!' 'Pachette!' 'Oh, Laura!'
'I hope you'll stay?' 'Dear cousin Laura!'
Her Moscow cousin, Princess Laura,
Go on about their special aura.
And so I lived in old Odessa . . .
I lived back then in dry Odessa . ..
Buynov whirls off Pustyakva;
To Tanya, Lensky; Harlikva,
Of brilliant Nina Voronskya,*
We'll show your Tanya.
When off beside my lake I climb
The secret refuge of the tomb. . . .
Of me the world shall soon grow dumb;
In some old tattered almanac
And in the next an almanac
Meanwhile Zaretsky, born mechanic,
In anguished writhing, almost manic,
And fear assails her; in a panic
Impatient, but in no great panic,
Blending the plain and idealistic
Half humorous, half pessimistic,
It's time: my pen demands a pillow; Nine cantos have I duly wrought, And now the ninth and final billow To joyful shore my bark has brought. All praise to you, #62038; nine Camenae,* etc.
Your Olga's look is cold and dead,
Along with fashions long since dead:
But lest too soon I join the dead, 
On one whose heart has long been dead,
His former love of life was dead.
His neighbour spoke: 'Well then, he's dead.'
A voice proclaim: 'Well then, he's dead!'
But where, God knows. All trace is dead.
Goes out of us when youth is dead
For rural cunning isn't dead!):
And entertain the nearly dead,
Tatyana lies there nearly dead.
Before the raging gulf ahead.
She views the winter path ahead.
For whom but darkness lies ahead?
His wedding day two weeks ahead;
While he plays horse and runs ahead;
The garden lane, when straight ahead,
I'll see you in the day ahead....
The first four steps that lay ahead
To pat the old man's laurelled head!
A kerchief on her grizzled head,
Sweet Lei* now floats above her head,
Unfit for maiden's heart or head),
While thoughts of money filled his head.
And silently he hung his head.
To put a bullet through his head,
To fluff the pillows for his head,
And on her shoulder rests his head. . . .
The pistol in his hand like lead,
Dear Lord have mercy. God, I plead!
Hear my confession too, I plead,
Will point my portrait out and plead:
As if in terror I had read
Her shoulders, face, and breast. With dread
On bivouac; then hears with dread
Tatyana stopped in sudden dread
He rants at them, his eyes turn dread;
My first few stanzas I once read
I close. I dare not now reread. . . . 
Will you at last cut memory's thread?
And lifting up her veil, she'll read
Which Lensky, blushing, leaves unread. . . .
At first she didn't wish to read,
The heap of books, the carpet spread
With quiet, firm, and measured tread,
What vernal flowers do you tread?
She sees an unknown yard instead:
And ended up the dunce instead.
I'd choose the elder one instead
Has flown to someone else instead;
By filling them with song instead
For strange and simple tongues instead
And missed the room she'd always had.
Lure some likely lusty lad 
For Richardson was simply mad.
Enrich the slumbering heart's dull load,
Left Tanya moved; but she felt sad
His wife herself, we ought to add,
The mysteries of the marriage bed
His living tears upon the bed
Before the window on the bed,
And driven home alone to bed.
She just undressed and went to bed.
Then supper came, then time for bed,
And, sighing, started home for bed;
Already bored, to uncle's bed,
Beside the tender maiden's bed,
And lays her on a makeshift bed,
Immobile, mute, and cherub-faced;
Beside the door stood tightly laced,
Far from the Rome his heart embraced.
And whether, pierced,
But not the timid maid who'd pleaded,
'Oh, I'm in love,' again she pleaded
The fame of Lovelaces has faded
While near at hand, all dense and shaded,
For he'd become so fully jaded,
The gambler's here with dice all loaded,
Lit by the sun as it paraded;
For there, at heart, I feel persuaded
The aunts exchanged a wink and nodded,
And with an elbow each one prodded
Some even knowingly conceded
Of course not all his pranks succeeded
But my Eugene all evening heeded
Or passed unpunished or unheeded,
But now it's over. Supper's heeded.
The stylish rings the couple needed.
To servants' quarters. Rest is needed
I've drawn a plan and know what's needed,
Onegin was, so some decided
Eugene and I had both decided
She checked her funds and then decided,
As sentiments to be derided,
(Strict judges, not to be derided),
But all too soon our paths divided,
Was this the Tanya he once scolded
Where first our novel's plot unfolded?
He sang of love, by love commanded,
And now at last the wait has ended;
Can it be true, my heyday's ended
(As I in jest so oft pretended)?
Nearby St Chariton's it ended
Outside the door of his intended.
She found a cue left unattended
And now, alas! . . . she lives attended
This tiring trek through town extended
His riding crop. And on she wended.
Then gave it up and finally ended
The greatest hall when it resounded,
Now the mazurka's call is sounded.
Bedraped in dresses long outmoded;
Each with a different dogma girded;
As love's high art. . . and was applauded
Time was, when cold debauch was lauded
And judge me both by word and deed.
The choice of books seemed strange indeed;
When in a frenzied state indeed
You've guessed already. Yes, indeed:
'This was a poet, yes indeed!'
She fell in love. For thus indeed
Of chosen ones whom men should heed,
To which Eugene paid special heed,
No more at dawn does shepherd need
Has flown to Tanya's in his need.
Just tell me, dearest, what you need.
And flies uphill with all his speed;
A happy and immortal breed,
Like him, she dressed as taste decreed.
A family with a single creed,
And never asked if she agreed.
Or where he'd tacitly agreed.
All sons of boredom's endless greed.
Does spring awake the buried seed.
To halt just there her panting steed;
He'd plunged in mud from Kalmuk steed,
The girlish hopes on which I fed,
Sweet talk with friends, on which I've fed.
And off the guests would drive, well fed.
And distant lands where once he'd shed
The language of the gods she shed
'Ah, whither, whither are ye banished,
In what grim desert, madman, banished,
And where has youth (glib rhyme) been banished?
O dreams! Where has your sweetness vanished?
By chance those verses haven't vanished;
Ah, dearest feet, where have you vanished?
Her virgin brooding once had cherished
From all that I had ever cherished
The bosom friend she'd always cherished
There lies a spot the poet cherished:
Amid this peaceful life they cherished,
Farewell, my freedom, deeply cherished!
What's more: poor guiltless Lensky perished,
Farewell, fond nature, where I flourished!
Not far from where the youth once flourished
At Shrovetide feasts their table flourished
The darling sister whom she'd nourished,
And, gazing at the moon, she'd nourished
A stable, fence, and kitchen shed.
The wood with mournful murmur shed
The heaped-up wagons now are readied;
They're harnessed to the coach and steadied;
The flame within him would have died.
All elegiac play aside That now indeed my spring has died
And here great Mithridates* died,
Her bow was calm and dignified.
With men he knew or friends he spied,
The two old ladies hugged and cried,
To his estate, where first she cried
About the stable, many cried;
True Gaul, Triquet in pocket carried
I married. . . .
A verse to warn that Tanya tarried,
Come this way, please . . . but don't feel hurried.
'Our neighbour Lensky, lately buried,
Orestes with his friend here vied,*
Contented with the life I led.
Keeps nothing of its heart concealed:
What languor when his lips were sealed,
What fiery art his speech revealed!
Are babbled out and soon revealed.
And sometimes he himself got bled
'Oh nurse, your wits are all befuddled!'
I'm old; my mind ... it does get muddled.
Whose cordial hand shall then be led
The bear just followed where she led.
And I confess, from them I fled,
Oh, many, many days have fled
With apprehensive step . . . then fled!
By everyone. Eugene has fled
His very memory now has fled
The panes chalked white. The owner's fled;
This note's to him.''Now don't get riled,
Forever hounded and reviled
The crafty husband fawned and chuckled
The sky breathed autumn, turned and darkled;
'Twas evening and the heavens darkled.
The friendly sun less often sparkled;
Were bound for home. Still waters sparkled.
His distant homeland he recalled.
And, by these coastal cliffs enthralled,
Now doomed to wither unfulfilled!
Scarce out of infant clothes and killed!
And he, alas, by friend lies killed!
The youthful lover's voice is stilled,
Whose heart.. . experience has cooled
And barred from being loved ... or fooled!
A London dandy, hair all curled,
That endless chant the waves unfurled
His Blackie seated on the sled,
The masses of your mountains gleamed;
Your valleys, woods, and hamlets seemed
And looked about, perplexed and chastened
The moody fellow, still unchastened,
And so, scarce breathing, down she hastened
Has my Eugene directly hastened?
The ladies' gowns so well designed;
Is this the lot you've been assigned?
Of some misfortune ill defined.
And nothing grand or more refined.
When, 'neath your endless chant I pined
Had someone else for whom she pined
For this your ardent spirit pined
Two pine trees grow there, roots entwined;
To make the foreign tour we'd planned;
That, like proud Byron, I have penned
Right then and there Vladimir penned
Without them my Onegin's fashioned.
And she from whom I drew, impassioned,
And soon the open doorway beckoned.
Believe me, you 'd have never learned 
My secret shame, had I discerned 
Through which he entered, newly crowned.
'That heavy general?' Tanya frowned.
While women wept and doctors frowned.
The days grew short and as they sped,
And bade the envoy, if he cared,
An elegy, to show he cared.
Drew back and stopped when he appeared. . . .
And in my garden* she appeared
When in that silent room appeared
A huge and matted bear appeared!
Tatyana screamed! He growled and reared,
And she, as if by fire seared,
To say that he was quite prepared. 
Then, leaning by the door, prepared
Long dormant feelings, scarce remembered.
His blissful spirit unencumbered
Or lulled by Lethe, has he slumbered,
Was like a blow. Onegin shuddered,
And so, far off in thought she wandered:
As artless as the one you tendered;
But all the while, as Tanya pondered,
Off to be charmed by dreams and cheered,
But then her course abruptly veered,
The old mazurka hasn't faltered;
Remain the same; they've not been altered
The blow has left poor Lensky shattered;
You ought to, really . . . they'll be flattered;
And gallops off. Now nothing mattered
Since then, it seems, they've hardly mattered.
He turned at last and vaguely fluttered
'It's time for something new,' he muttered,
The awful word, so lightly uttered,
Its wondrous veil to stand uncovered;
A deathly pallor merely covered
While taking leave, Tatyana hovered
Turned south; and all around there hovered
From walls ancestral portraits glowered;
Throughout the house the ceilings towered,
Majestic wigs and heels of red.
A land by which the mind is fired:
And here Mickiwicz* sang inspired,
Why, I can picture theminspired,
Those desert wastes and waves inspired,
'Had I in any way desired
Just now though, friends, I feel too tired
Then gave her spouse a look so tired,
Back then it seemed that I required
Some would that ladies be required
Or had a happy fate required
I've talked so long that I've required
He found he couldn't. She enquired
They whisper: 'Dunya, don't look bored!'
(With whom today we're rather bored)
Nor was it that she much preferred
And while the 'honest chap' conferred
Whose head is never fancy-stirred,
Onegin was profoundly stirred:
What wars and famines have occurred?
The works of Fontenelle he scoured;*
To take some tea while Dunya poured;
Then turned to see the books he'd favoured.
But soon her thirsting spirit savoured
The sceptic Bayle he quite devoured,
But Tanya's heart is far from captured:
From bathhouse roof to wash, enraptured,
And there's Mashk,* all green-encased,
With those who'd known the now deceased;
Might well have raised, before it ceased,
With his immoral soul disclosed,
His arid vanity exposed,
(Till on the fields, spring rains have passed)
Unchanged when even years have passed.
Can it be true, its bloom has passed,
The way lies open; war has passed
The earth she walks, in splendour dressed!
As if a chilling hand had pressed
I was embittered, he depressed;
Where fingernails had sharply pressed;
The cold sharp mind that he possessed;
He reads them out like one possessed,
Well, almost all that they possessed.
And only nanny might have guessed,
And as his years of youth abated,
Or maybe he's just dedicated,
But that pretentious game is dated,
Give up a role when it's outdated.
You're just not well, you're overheated.'
And then their waltzing is repeated!
Those figures fancy has created
They've shifted round and been reseated;
He stays beside her when she's seated,
Onegin fired! The hour fated
He knew a kindred soul was fated
Or maybe he was merely fated
By being at this feast he hated,
Upon my trail, three years belated,
To sing the savage steppe,* elated;
The hubbub grows more animated . . .
Her happy dreams have animated:
To fad and fashion newly mated:
With spring he felt rejuvenated:
To wondrous shapes which designated
Tatyana watches, fascinated,
The cell in which he'd hibernated
With joy his heart anticipated
How oft. . . forlorn and separated
And here's Prolzov,* celebrated
That lamp to which we've consecrated
And here's Oneginliberated,
As you, Saint-Priest,* have demonstrated
With passion's game we both were sated;
But soon the guests are somewhat sated;
And then in silence meditated
Already cross and irritated
And won't then be evaluated
All this today seems antiquated
A country missinfatuated,
Each passing hour more captivated
When I recall how you reacted:
What dreams of hers were re-enacted?
Where lowly nature is enacted
And though, thank God, he never acted
'Twas this our hero had contracted;
The heavy silence grew protracted,
All evening Lensky was abstracted,
But you, perhaps, are not attracted
But those on whom the Muse has acted
How nobly in a sense you acted,
A bit provincial and affected,
Yet were not morals ill affected
Her soul, despite herself, infected
Didelot his crown of fame perfected.*
And at a walk she'll ride, dejected,
With no reply. He drives, dejected,
Assailed by doubts, she grew dejected:
And humble lot he'd once rejected? . . .
And so, for once, Eugene elected
No answer came. Eugene elected
By mighty Zeus's will elected
Undressed, by candle he selected
But then, by empty dreams deflected,
Just so a youthful rake reflected,
'Can it be true?' Eugene reflected.
She found Onegin's soul reflected
And all its solid form reflected
So much of life have I neglected
The printed verse had lain neglected
The covered sleigh, for years neglected,
I lost my way and recollected
And round Eugene there soon collected
And in the margins she inspected
Although Eugene with care inspected
On coming home, the youth inspected
That guests were soon to be expected;
Departure day was long expected;
They find her stranger than expected,
All these were new and unexpected,
His father diedquite unexpected,
A warmth in you quite unexpected,
He isn't here, I'm not expected. . . .
The ancient manse had been erected
From those backwoods!' And he directed
Corneille's full genius resurrected;
When first I met you and detected
This placid lady, he detected
Where all was shown ... all unprotected?
If her prim tomcat sat protected
And meantime I've just now completed
Whist's heroes have by now completed
But suddenly a snowbank shifted,
And who emerged when it was lifted?
Ah, Moscow! How that sound is freighted
He scrawled a note: he 'd be delighted.
Ah, friends, I too have been delighted
The girls near Tanya; men delighted
The good old lady was delighted
The desk, the lamp that stands unlighted,
By briny waves refreshed and righted,
When all at once far-off I've sighted
But wretched he who's too far-sighted,
The moment one of them was sighted
So Lensky soared as he awaited
That even now she pined and waited,
Vladimir gave his heart and waited
And for us both, ahead there waited
Five paces more, while Lensky waited
What's made that frigid soul excited?
Then bring in her guitar, excited . . .
The girls all jump and grow excited.
And there, my glowing pipe ignited,
And leaves her languid soul ignited:
And then the guest would be invited
Or heard approaching uninvited,
A beauty languid and enchanted!
Our friend Tumnsky* sang enchanted
For two full days he was enchanted
By sylvan shade that lay implanted
And in her heart the thought was planted . . .
How blest, shy lover, to be granted
But we must say that he was granted
Until at last her fate was granted:
By Tolstoy's* magic brush, and scented
You volumes nimbly ornamented
Then tossed about and seemed demented;
Alas! it's true: Eugene's demented,
He spends each day and night tormented
How wrong I've been! And how tormented!
Although the book she read presented
Estranged from men and discontented,
And settled down and grew contented.
No lines a poet had invented,
Believes the chosen dream she's painted
So why is Tanya, then, more tainted?
Beside the road the sunlight glinted.
I fall anointed,
Come each in turn as they're appointed;
He quit one sparkling morn and sprinted
Some others too might well have noted
Was at the time in full devoted
That sometimes heavy, but good-hearted,
How long ago did they, warmhearted,
Before that gaze so openhearted,
I'll think up speeches tenderhearted,
Then, wined and dined and heavy-hearted,
How often, on the course I charted,
Outside the gate Tatyana parted
But let us then as friends be parted,
All jealousy and rage departed
Of some fair mistress long departed
But from that band I soon departed
They laid to rest the dear departed;
And so the friends departed
The foes! How long has bloodlust parted
She rose at dawn and off she started
And so, life's afternoon has started,
So books, like women, he deserted,
But now, as in a house deserted,
Bemoans her worthless mate, deserted
The window boards have been inserted,
'In all this world what's more perverted
To stay with us and seemed transported;
My word, that little devil courted!
My thanks to you. With you I've tasted,
What's more, that duelling fox has tasted
And so our maiden fully tasted
Enough! Clear-souled and far from wasted,
Unluckily, Dame Larin wasted
'Too late,' he thought, 'the moment's wasted. . . .
He sees forgotten foes he'd bested,
Tatyana, as her nurse suggested,
Companions whom he now detested . . .
And so in secret she requested
A backwoods genius, he commuted
The old corve and substituted
With tenderness and pain imbued,
Our Lensky's seat, there lived and thrived
A new persona has arrived:
By rank in turn as each deserved.*
And at their table guests were served
Like noble Regulus,* he bowed,
And by the Heavens was endowed
Are ever thus; with brow perplexed,
' Zaretsky bit his lip, well vexed.
A nook where pensive dryads played.
Nor even Fashion Plates Displayed
Fine china, bronzesall displayed;
In which our age is well displayed
Perfumes in crystal jars arrayed;
The fateful news, he'd been betrayed?
And modern man himself portrayed
But recently this winter stayed,
The trees in winter silver dyed,
A mere exchange of looks conveyed
When mid the guests she recognized
The one she feared, the one she prized
Before the hearth the table's laid.
Has painted us the snow new-laid
Had ever so engrossed a maid:
My tribute to the mountain maid,
Not far from our unhappy maid,
Of white-skinned, dark-eyed country maid;
Just so in carefree song I paid
And my Zaretsky, as I've said,
'In dry Odessa'so said I. I might have said:
Was all that Olga, smiling, said.
As Sadi* long before us said.
As clear as maiden thoughts, as candid
Of wandering tribes; and like a child,
He'd furnish his beloved child
And then Monsieur took on the child,
But you've gone pale again, my child!'
A charming lad, though somewhat wild.
She learned their ways and soon grew wild:
And could she now have been so bold,
On winter nights all dark and cold.
Oh God!my blood can still turn cold
They still assail a soul grown cold
So unconcerned with him ... so cold?
And to their passions ever cold.
To you, I'm sure, was trite and old.
And watched a different world unfold.
The glory of our days of old,
Sits ananas in splendid gold.
The trembling dreams the heart can hold.
And on my heart retain their hold.
Indifferent to the views they hold,
And the majestic, antlered cuckold
Quite charmed her heart when they were told
The mystery that those pages told
In praise of him who made the world.
So this is what it means to see the world!
At last he's ready for the world!
And been as happy ... as I could!
And mortgaged all the land he could.
'Won't call me "sir" the way he should.
While next to Limburg's lively mould
Bassoon and flute announce the band.
A throng of nymphs her guardian band,
She took it with a trembling hand
Upon the porch, with broom in hand,
he Good Samaritan* in hand!
Have scarcely taken cups in hand,
But lo! . . . with crimson hand
And each takes pistol into hand.
For fate took matters into hand.
And letters in a maiden's hand.
The sombre season near at hand;
Of Tanya's letter from my hand.
Then feel her foot within my hand!
Dense brush abounds; on every hand
A blessed and most favoured land!
All round the nomad-tented land
November marched across the land.
My country's honour will demand
What more, my friends, could you demand?
To read in Russian. Dread command!
Then has the horses, on command,
And him for whom, by fate's command,
A drawn-out tale of fancies grand,
Then leads each man to where he'll stand,
The sheep of Kalmuk herdsmen stand,
My Tanya starts to understand
Istmina* takes up her stand.
In cherished dreams I sometimes stand
Removed to where two oaklings stand.
Forlorn and drifting snowbanks stand;
Where two expectant merchants stand.
To Tanya, who could barely stand;
You'll be my guardian till the end. . . .
They squeeze her hand and, in the end,
At first disturbed me, in the end
Holds but oblivion in the end.
Who won't betray us in the end?
A mere self-portrait in the end;
I don't know why; but in the end
Would listen gravely to the end
A funeral verse for his old friend.
The voice of lover, foe, and friend
Well, she's just promised his good friend
Are entered by each would-be friend
Long live Bordeaux, our noble friend!
To have the family, that's all, friend;
My last poor pence . . . remember, friend?
Take Tanya in and call her friend;
and whether you be foe or friend,
To my old nurse, my childhood's friend;
When self-expression gripped his friend;
And though the language of my friend
If you were with me still, my friend,
It hardly mattered to my friend,
In pledge of meeting you, my friend; 
Diminished, lengthened, turned on end.
Quite possibly for years on end!
Its magic stream brought forth no end
As comrades now. Whatever end
To share a quiet evening's end.
What roses Hymen means to send
(Those dreams and harmonies I tend)
What's this he hears? Could she intend? . . .
Our words and deeds as we intend?
'Why not at all, they just intend
Your genius for a worthy end:
I can't translate this phrase, I find.)
A substitute for joy I'd find.
I love their feetalthough you'll find
With every tribute he can find:
Because in tripe the solemn find
On every side you seem to find
A truer love you'll never find.
For several days she couldn't find
Calls up the life she left behind
Du comme il faut. . . (Shishkov,* be kind:
By pictures of this simple kind,
And on the whole despised mankind,
Perhaps (if fate should prove unkind!)
Can Fate indeed be so unkind?
That our good friend was only kind
Yet wasn't, like so many, blind;
A way to calm her troubled mind.
A man whose heart and soul and mind
Mistakes in grammar charm the mind.
I thought: in freedom, peace of mind,
When you, with so much strength of mind,
As dark forebodings filled her mind
She's stifled here . . . and in her mind
A worthy object! Never mind,
As phantom daydreams haunt your mind:
His poet's soul, his artist's mind;
A noble heart and upright mind.
Were these the thoughts that crossed my mind
And malice rules a petty mind?
Beneath them quiet streamlets wind,
Anisya came in just a second,
And plunging into deep despond,
And all the ditches that abound
About this unknown belle he'd found.
Until at last the husband found
There too a tombstone can be found
Where is your equal to be found!
Surprised next morning when he found,
And cleared the darkened mind she found.
But then their charming wives he found
A laid-out corpse was what he found,
That's fine of course, but all I've found
At talk were even less profound.
Against the ramrods mallets pound.
Put straight his wig and asked around
She casts no brazen glance around
All around
Is barren steppeland all around,
A serving boy took cream around.
Zaretsky had again called round;
No stir disturbs the silence round,
To fall like stars upon the ground.
Prepared as tribute for the ground.
Throughout our native Russian ground.
The rousing waltz goes whirling round.
Come flitting, flicking, swirling round
He just moved off. . . . He's turning round.'
The call that brings them gathering round.
Turn meadows into marshy ground
And strip the forest bare all round.
Passed on in bed ... his children round,
In savage glee; all eyes turn round,
The god that makes this world go round!
In all the cups; without a sound
Of feeling, thought, and magic sound.
The glasses jingle and resound.
The first sharp hammer clicks resound.
Young life's own whirlwind, full of sound,
Her slender form; fierce cackles sound
Of briar blooms, and freshets sound.
To hear the sea's incessant sound,
Except the sea's incessant sound.
Nor does his horn at midday sound
And makes no effort to astound
The spring with which our honour's wound!
Had hungered for the fatal food;
In pledge of beauty and of good,
Prepared to die for love of good;
They knew they'd settled that for good.
' The general verdict wasn't good.
The distant vault of heaven's hood;
So rend my soul, so flame my blood.
No, never once did passion's flood
As far as Lensky's wedding stood,
The ever dauntless hero stood
His father never understood
The nightingale in darkest wood
That long ago she'd often heard
Than bearing all his pain unheard.
Now doomed by death to pass unheard;
The two friends' greetings pass unheard;
Good reasoned talk was also heard,
So wrapt in thought she hasn't heard.
But here, your trip has left you haggard;
I drag about like some poor laggard.
He drives to Nevsky Boulevard,
' 'But who's it for, my little bird?
You're still my little early bird!
I gave my word, but, Lord,
And Grandison, the noble lord
Just lies in bed without a word,
'At my insistence.' Behind the mill, without a word.
Her tears well up without a word
My name, or breathe a single word. . . .
The last (eighth) chapter of Eugene Onegin was published separately with the following foreword:
Some sacred truth, a living word,
Who hates all gestures, each warm word,
But not a trite or vulgar word,
So here's his letter word for word.
He has to have the latest word.
Last night you scared me, 'pon my word!
A swarm of thoughts with every word;
Her stormy scenes and wails aloud
The press intense, the hubbub loud;
He draped a linen mourning shroud.
A brazen chap all starched and proud,
(A prize to make the French feel proud!).
Because she's trusting more than proud,
Before the dull and frigid crowd;
Provoked amusement in the crowd
A bold mazurka grips the crowd,
And over all that dusty crowd
My novel's shape or what would be.
In all her schemes he'd never probe;
And ate and drank in just his robe.
Come tell me how it used to be.'
Martyn Zadck soon came to be
The frigid, yawning days to be,
A misty dream of what might be.
The fields all lay in misty peace;
By shooting at his pallid face
Intelligence and handsome face.
The one to whom, when face to face,
But once a weekI'd see your face, 
To melt with pain before your face,
Before his darling Olga's face,
Her eyes have opened . . . seen his face!
And seen in all. . . Onegin's face.
And barren age has shown its face,
There's wrath alone upon that face . . .
I feel her breath upon my face!
I plead with tears upon my face 
So be it then! Henceforth I place 
Both wit and brains were out of place,
They're leaving for the duelling place,
On granting him his resting place
The night before and what took place;
When in some quiet rural place
And as she gazed upon that place
With visions of some distant place,
In that forsaken, distant place
Behold you at our country place, 
A magic night, the moon's embrace. . . .
Are filled with girls in sleep's embrace.
All day, all night, in sleep's embrace
Or hint of inner lyric grace;
Has pictured with a single grace,
All gone are youth's bright years of grace,
And grant the world redeeming grace.*
With all my soul your perfect grace;
With tender soul and manly grace,
Horace
Her pounding heart began to race.
Would one day shine upon our race
And where the tearstains? . . . Not a trace!
How sad is faded passion's trace! . . .
As from the meadow your light trace.
A word of warning should suffice.
A Moscow winter would be nice.
Like you and me, to being nice?
Is often easy, even nice.
Recall Moi'na* . . . and rejoice
O Brenta!* I shall yet rejoice,
I hear at last your magic voice!
That everyone has heard his voice.
The winter road is smooth as ice.
I pray you, heed my sound advice,
To hear such sensible advice;
In any case, here's my advice:
The youthful lover of the dance
Or see the Russian muse of dance
At first Madame was in attendance;
To the circle of our dance.
Zaretsky favoured stout reliance
But called for strict and full compliance
With mournful air and brooding glance,
Oh, Olga's every trait.... But glance
For her confessions of romance.
And in her hands a French romance.
His unexpected reappearance,
But Tanya, in a kind of trance,
And managed to dispel her trance;
I lack the strength for true repentance,
With our Zaretsky at a distance
From some quite gentlemanly distance.
Her voice, her form, her graceful stance,
Fate watched Eugene in his dependence;
In missives writ in love's defence
Or brawling boy to take offence,
Or saddened by the re-emergence
We heed the rustling wood's resurgence,
Without a foreword's interference,
The strangeness of his interference
And Gallicisms in a sentence
Still pleasanter is mute insistence
Slow Lethe, then, with grim insistence,
I'll say without wrought-up insistence
To share my baneful, sad existence,
Will drown my memory's brief existence;
'She knows you?''We were neighbours, Prince.'
When all agree and have long since;
'To whom? How long?''Some two years since . . .
Or trying gravely to convince
Love's luring phial, you who once
Assault the senses all at once.
Made me a drunken, love-filled dunce!)
From every Moscow fop and Circe!
He pours out tunes that effervesce,
Nor watch this two-day blossom fade
The cue's forgot, the billiards fade;
The burbling brook, the wooded shade,
In deaf eternity's grim shade,
And winter's joys in every shade.*
My lovely lily, stalk and blade;
A vast neglected garden made
The sorry sight the fellow made.
And o'er the lacquered boards we glide.
Now carried off by fate, a bride,
She stands beneath the crown a bride,
Makes off with Lensky's future bride.
While I, mid friends, was drunk with pride
All vain and languorous with pride,
Both honour and a manly pride.
Had called you out in fiery pride?
I know that in your heart reside
Well, tell me: what would you . . . inside
Forever parted from her side.
With shouts of joy on either side.
And at the altar by his side,
Tatyana to our hero's side,
Then eighteen nags were led outside.
Her manner stayed the same outside,
Gay magpies on the lawn outside,
A fair Venetian at my side,
My flighty mistress at my side.
Paved highways, linking every side,
(With God knows whom on every side),
A crowd of slaves on every side?
Then trading bows on every side
But in small town and countryside
To live amid the common tide;
Now chatting, now a silent guide,
Will cross our Russia far and wide;
He once again rejects the monde.
More often visit my abode;
My sparkling youth, before you flee!
Oh, where and why do I now flee?
I tremble with malicious glee;
It's time to quit this dreary lee
And thus preserved by fate's decree,
Perhaps, my friends, by fate's decree,
unconstrained, quite calm and free.
To keep sly mouths from feeling free
The vision too of 'maiden free,'
A feast of youthful fancies free,
A pond for ducks to wallow free.
And Flora's cheek, I quite agree;
Plus Marmontel*just volume three.
And 'neath the spreading willow tree
As I must now admit, I see.
Small hamlets too the eye could see
Or through the magic crystal see
And Egypt's son as well you'll see,
We'd never heard of love, you see.
She's like that stupid moon you see,
(An edict that was meant, you see,
I'm young and still robust, you see;
Her brimming eyes could hardly see.
Whose peasants lead a wretched life;
And used to say: "Oh grant me, life,
And mid the hum and hush of life,
Alone both day and night through life;
So pleased with all he had in life:
Now every man has foes in life,
My fertile fancies spring to life.
And spleen, he saw, would dog his life,
Could find no purpose for his life.
To be respected in this life;
Far more than some who part this life.
And I'll be faithful all my life.'
To bind with family ties my life;
Onegin snatches up a knife,
Abused him roundly, used the knife.
Its time will pass without my knife,
A rending cry amid the strife
For country calm and lack of strife;
They haunt my soul with dreams of strife.
That I turn father, take a wife;
Than homes in which the wretched wife
Like shadow or a faithful wife.
By children and by faithful wife
Without position, work, or wife
Himself, his dinner, and his wife.
But I am now another's wife,
Is bound by any righteous wife
Has come and brought his portly wife;
He destined Olga for my wife
A fool, at eighteen years of age,
Secure at last from tempest's rage,
And why not let the poet rage!
Lives out his life a proper sage,
With spellings awesome in abusage,
Unmetred lines of hallowed usage
But surely, Your honour's all the pledge 
A perilous and shaky bridge;
The chasm's banks atop the ridge:
More pleasant yet, my friends, if he
So round and fair of face is she,
And in my heart I cried: It's he!
They're closer . . . coming here . . . it's he!
He never pictured once, not he.
The devil take you, Uncle. Die!'
And let the conversation die.
To judge the wit with which I lie.
This swirling swamp in which we lie
'Odessa gushing' And even so have told no lie.
And there where now his ashes lie
Rveillez-vous, belle endormie* 
To sizing up a lavish pie*
To wander by the lonely lake
Each morning early I'm awake
He'd hear mid hum and hush alike
His grumbling soul the hours strike,
An empty phantom or a joke,
And then Eugene approached and spoke:
And there where Tartar tongues are spoke
I've read your words and they evoke
What passions in my soul awoke!
She walks upon a snowy dale,
Or was he profligate and hale
Of brushes for the modern male
The fire in both our hearts was pale;
Now nature, tremulous, turns pale
Our lives were weary, flat, and stale;
The hero of my current tale:
And Strasbourg pie,* that deathless fable;
They steal away whenever able
A couch, two cupboards, and a table,
Their elbows propped upon the table;
A bloody roastbeef's on the table,
The furnishings were plain but stable:
'There'll be a crush and lots of babble
And all that crowd of local rabble.'
That sets the aching heart atremble
I've faith in you and do not tremble;
Perhaps in thought we reassemble,
I love you (why should I dissemble?);
How early on he could dissemble,
A living picture's pallid double,
Now my Eugene, Chadyev's* double,
From jealous critics fearing trouble,
Enchanting, yet so fraught with trouble?
A dinner fanciful and idle,
A horse of spirit fit to bridle,
Preoccupied by work ... or idle,
Extinguished ashes won't rekindle,
Within my soul will fade and dwindle:
In mud waist-high the houses snuggle;
The coaches and the people struggle,
His blend of banter and of bile,
Within this strange new domicile
Cosmopolite? A Slavophile?
Childe Harold? Melmoth for a while?
To lull black empty thoughts awhile;
Confused with tender shame the while
Her lowered eyes aflame the while,
But one persistent thought the while.
But what of our Eugene this while?
. . But where's our lady all this while?)
He has no voice. Without a smile,
Like crimson lips without a smile,
Already learned to cheat and smile!
And on her lips a slender smile.
(Encouraged, though, by Olga's smile),
The sick old lady's kindly smile
Her flaxen curls, her lovely smile,
Already has she mastered guile,
Her sky-blue eyes, devoid of guile,
There's not a calumny too vile
Nasce una gente, a cui l'morir non dole.*
Would mend life's thread and make it whole;
Felt far from happy with his role.
Who plays an unwed father's role,
But mine must be a brother's role.
He'd drink his coffee, sometimes sample
Gulnare's proud singer* his example,
Shall I abandon every scruple
The hall is full of crowds and bustle;
He laughsthey all guffaw and bustle;
With laughter, kisses, din and hustle;
He gives a signthe others hustle;
And with my wilful Muse let's hustle
To where the leafy woodlands rustle
Or that my husband, maimed in battle,
To shake their heads, to prate and prattle,
Some tea to whet their tittle-tattle;
A cause for all the monde to tattle
Call out for men to try their mettle:
And so, for all his fiery mettle,
Now streams of greyish powder settle
To help those pies and beefsteaks settle,
At green-baize tables players settle,
I'll tell it all in detailed style
Twould make an epigram of style.* .
His sombre wit and biting style.
I find a faultless Russian style
Around each painted belle and dame.
The thirst for knowledge, work, and fame,
To social scandal's kind of fame?
I live, I writenot seeking fame;
Those mighty years still rich in fame. . .
And earn me tribute paid to fame:
The endless round, the varied game;
The fields are dark now, what a shame.
The dread of vice, the fear of shame?
Tatyana bowed her head in shame,
Distorted readings, noise, and blame!
As if they all thought her to blame.
Just so a soldier, old and lame,
They stir our hearts and fan the flame.
Revive it with a jealous flame;
To pledge my token to your name
A tender novel with that name.*
The sombre men who form a frame
Tomorrow too will be the same.
Oh come now, friend, it's all the same.
More bored than usual.''No, the same.
We'll whip his heart, and when it's tame . . .
The years chase playful rhyme behind me,
Tatyana's letter lies beside me,
I read it with an ache inside me
And merely as an idle scheme,
They glower coldly as they scheme
The years to solemn prose incline me;
A patterned vision spread before me.
What mad and magic yearnings tore me
Would just have been the death of me!'
#62038; God, what must he think of me!
Onegin, pausing, thought of me.
And introduced a new regime.
Until Brguet's* unsleeping chime
And early church bellswhen they chime,
Whereas the ode has aims sublime.
Its want of purpose is a crime;
Before their hands are stained with crime?
And blest who ripened in his prime;
Relief from labours for a time,
Announcing dawn and working time
The chill of life with passing time;
Reminds him that it's dinner time.
Should they not laugh while yet there's time,
Came close to grasping at that time
But thou, fair maiden, wilt thou come!
From cellar store has just now come
Then swift as arrows raced for home.
Farewell, celestial beauty's home,
His daughter read or kept at home
Thus peopleso it seems to me
Nor did he care what secret tome
And what does Fate prepare for me?'
And then the dream came true for me!
And there the Muse spread out for me
When some new demon seizes me;
Shrieks out in stupid shock: that's me!
Their quartos to be signed by me,
Put up the window ... sit by me.'
Beset with yearning and with rhyme
The principles of Russian rhyme.
Live images, or wit in rhyme,
My present novel's Chapter One.
Some memory of that park and lane,
We've roamed the world down one slim lane
He's happy now, he's almost sane. . . .
A nameless river's placid scene,
That friend of freedom ruled the scene,
Onegin now has left the scene
His kinsman and his friend Eugene.
Tatyana pictures her Eugene,
That marks his face? ... Is that Eugene? !
The country place where my Eugene,
But what of my Eugene?
The princess looked at himserene;
So inaccessibly serene,
A golden, sparkling fine champagne,
An endless bottle of champagne
All point at her and all combine
Of twisted slanders might combine
My stylish house where princes dine
Seclusion, quietthese, in fine,
All this, dear readers, meant in fine:
Is duty free and rather fine.
Clarissa,* Julia,* or Delphine.*
I'll grant the censor's right to shine
#62038; Muse of Epics, may you shine 
A contest for his crown ... or thine,
But I've no wish to change a line;
Would call Praskvya 'chre Pauline'.
I'm duelling with a friend of mine.
I sing a youthful friend of mine. 
This weary tinselled life of mine,
Or halt this heavy dream of mine
And in this poet's cup of mine
But can one justly, friends of mine,
My hero's features here with mine
To shout as one: 'She's mine! She's mine!'
And fill the page that follows mine.'
Perceives herself as heroine 
The very flower of French cuisine,
Thou bard of Finland's maid divine!*
A bottle of some sparkling wine,
One occupies himself with wine:
Compare this do-re-mi with wine?
Especially since the local wine
And good and bad all intertwine.
I now mix water with my wine.
His slipper or his magazine!
What din, debates! The good Automne*
The dreadful harm of what he'd done.
The altar fire is out and done! . . .
And loathes the awful thing he's done.
The only clever thing he's done.
The hero's named, the plotting's done;
You won't be pleased to see it done.
But pleased to have their duty done,
But now at last his doubts were gone:
Her breathing stops, all sense is gone.
Until at last her strength is gone.
Can bring him back: the singer's gone,
And recollect a time that's gone?
They say you like to be alone 
Before his gaze. And these alone
To see the vacant house alone
Or harden and congeal alone,
You cannot know: I'm so alone, 
nd drew all eyes to her alone.
Tatyana . . . only her alone:
Mid wives and maidens shines alone.
Except of course ourselves alone.
When by the hearth he'd sit alone
'Where master used to sit alone.
Then, surely, none but you alone
And mediocrity alone
'And here's the hearth,' spoke up the crone,
To hug her parentseither one;
Just like the moon upon her throne,
And in their dens bewailed as one
And Benedetto* he'd intone
To turn at last to lifeless stone
We lack, I know, a worldly tone, 
She lacked that fresh and rosy tone
To which he yielded one by one,
The priests and guests left one by one.
The poet's gone . . . and hardly one
So we in fancy then were borne
A simple and affecting tune,
The nightingale pours forth its tune.
It's pleasant to provoke a foe;
The modish beauty's modish foe,
On treacherous ice in blunted shoe,
Examine her from head to toe.
(All futures seemed alike in woe)
And innocence can lead to woe.'
Evokes some pity for my woe, 
The landed gentwith daughters ripe,
Let's prick vainglory first with hope,
And bind him tighter with our rope;
With decks of cards of every type,
Through grand salon. And on! ... All bare.
On rain and flax and cattle care. . . .'
His pencil marks with special care;
She doesn't see or doesn't care;
I can't, though, readers, help but care
But shy and frightened, does not dare
I long for peace, for simple fare:
Which young Semynova did share;
To family dinners just to share
And artifice that ladies share
And then in private he'd prepare
No welcome feast did she prepare
Or why am I not old and spare,
With lots of jam and talk to spare.
Just cabbage soup and room to spare.
Through drawing rooms he'd pass and stare;
With watchful mothers, aunts who stare,
The way the watchful servants stare,
They sit. Eugene can only stare,
Abandon Hope, Who Enter Here!
'Good God, man, where's your second? Where?'
The hostess cries, 'At last you're here!'
They seem to go before they're here!
Beneath this stone now resteth here.
I have them, and I quote them here:
A lively, varied atmosphere.
Would dine with him in winter here.
Oh, Tanya sweet, come over here
The company commander's here!
That sorceress the winter's here!
His incandescent Olga there.
Galop, mazurka, waltz. . . . And there,
Life pulses full as here and there,
Some serf girls in the orchard there,
Repose in peace, young poet, here!'
The restless hero waiting there
But neither whist, nor gossip there,
'Just never mind . . . now look up there . . .
Like that poor tax collector there?
Is quite alone. Some minutes there
He opens up a door. . . . What's there
And our Katnin gave us there
Than he who brought the lady there
Or if she happened anywhere
And on those pages everywhere
He sang life's bloom gone pale and sere
Ptri de vanit il avait encore plus de cette espce d'orgueil qui fait avouer avec la mme indiffrence les bonnes comme les mauvaises actions, suite d'un sentiment de supriorit, peut-tre imaginaire.
In duels a purist doctrinaire,
And found the source of lyric fire
A spirit strange but full of fire,
And it may touch some heart with fire;
In such a burst of moral fire,
His soul aflame with virgin fire.
It may be he was born to fire
While some rude Cyclops at his fire
Stood seared, as if by heaven's fire.
With all her marble beauty's fire
Tir d'une lettre particulire*
And she, whose beauty I admire
And thanks the Lord for ruts and mire
To show my Muse a grand soire;
Have asked him to a grand soire.
But why on earth does he inspire
Or all the passions they inspire;
With what a tempest of desire!
She'd been condemned to feel desire:
He'd lectured gravely on desire?
But Lensky, having no desire
Could alter Lensky's deep desire,
And scorning then Apollo's ire
Had cursed the cook in useless ire,
Is it because we never tire
Had cordial hopes that he'd acquire
In vain my searching eyes enquire,
A faithful friend, a peaceful squire,
He settled where the former squire
From misty Germany our squire
The social buzz became a bore,
In talk of Olga. Love's a bore!
Ah, then, perhaps, the love she bore
Sensing the dreadful load they bore,
The manner grand can only bore.
And soon, quite soon, the tempest's core
There's no one else whom I'd adore; 
Have not those creatures you adore,
How wicked spleen had once before
Burns even stronger than before,
More rosy than the dawn before
The simple girl he'd known before,
The feet of ladies known before.
Each year they promised, as before,
You too have known such belles before.
That question you have put before:
The foot of sweet Terpsichore.
Or perched on granite by the shore.
They flap their wings and fly from shore.
Perhaps along the Neva's shore
Who ruled the queenly Neva's shore.
His father ran up debts galore;
Those objects of your verse . . . and more,
And then waxed voluble once more
To drive the body home once more.
to write again . . . and then once more
Who'd dreamt and loved, was born once more.
And now, my friends, I hear once more
Might well have made them friends once more!
Of faraway Eugene the more.
Enough now! Sing of something more!'
Is affectationnothing more.
The snow, his wife, and much, much more.
Turns curious to see still more
By feelings and perturbed no more,
Within me now they are no more:
But which today I use no more.
And though I grieve, I weep no more;
Were objects of his thought no more.
Like empty sounds exist no more,
In your slim tracks I'll stray no more,
And made me thine for evermore! 
Until he had no means for more.
Quite ceased to tempt him any more
Alas! We humans all ignore
And, presently, induced a snore;
And all we've learned from its great store
Her health, her calm, the smile she wore
You were the first that he forswore;
On "former days" and "times of yore";
So peace to you, you woes of yore!
And honoured patron of the barre
Malfiltre
The guests all squeeze toward the centre,
Whose potent light in all its lustre
The ice-clad river's glassy lustre;
But meanwhile, dressed for morning pleasure,
Enchanted with each passing pleasure,
Tatyana looks in melting pleasure
For luxury, for modish pleasure
For otherwise, grown bored with pleasure,
He'd spent some time with him with pleasure,
In racing droshkies bound for pleasure
Not thinking of the proud world's pleasure,
These clothes and faces with displeasure;
What from his prime had been his pleasure,
The balalaika's now my pleasure,
And famous!' But the plaintive measure
He takes a single glance to measure
And who'll be kind enough to measure
And then with doubt in fullest measure
And so was not in any measure
A housewife now is what I treasure;
But pensiveness, her friend and treasure
His only torment, toil, and treasure,
But whom to love? To trust and treasure?
''The peasants there have hoards of treasure,
Whatever Paris, seeking treasure,
I would have wished a finer treasure
She finds it all a priceless treasure,
Quite pampered by a life of leisure,
You too, young mistresses of leisure,
Adorned the course of rural leisure
To stroll about at total leisure,
A monster of Satanic feature,
Sublime emotion's every feature,
Or as a sad and raving creature,
He never shamed, the happy creature,
Drunk as a pig, and suffered capture
And off runs glutton youth to capture
To hear your voice. . . to try to capture
Accepting hostage bonds with rapture
What news of oysters? Here? What rapture!
To swoon and pass away . . . what rapture!
A gloried name; his silenced lyre
He roamed the world with singing lyre
But stop .. . Enough! My babbling lyre
To humble prose I'll bend my lyre:
What fate will morning bring my lyre?
But dare not bother with my lyre
The stanza fashioned by my lyre
Through Albion's great and haughty lyre*
Guillot's to fetch the pistol case.
Alone, beside the windowcase,
So grant them, God, long life and ease!
Some common madrigal to please,
Just send your grandson, will you please.'
To quite forget us, if they please
The modern Russian's new disease.
'It's nothing, nanny, be at ease,
And antiquated turns of phrase
That any zealous vulgar phrase
The caravan of cackling geese
His slow advance, was first to raise
(Which we, of course, in him should praise).
Receive our race's hymns of praise,
With sighs of passion and with praise.
'As God's my witness, dear, I promise.'
This world of glitter, fumes, and noise,
For empty glitter, fuss, and noise!
Moustaches, leaps, heel-pounding noise
The drawing room explodes with noise,
For she was bored by all their noise,
For storms and feasts and worldly noise,
Thus, slowly, down a sloping rise,
And as she reads, a tear will rise
A bloody spectre seemed to rise;
The guests all stare in mute surprise;
That friendly hands would surely rise
Just plays my stomach false,
Some raved or lied, and some were dense;
And then await sweet recompense.
Through force of passion and of sense,
But man of honour and of sense.
Some lacked all conscience; some, all sense;
Though on the whole he saw no sense
Although he seldom saw their sense.
Would listen with a look intense,
Expect the rhyme, so take itRose!)
Its happy rights ... as grand as those
As n in French .. . and through the nose;
When she was small she didn't choose
'Why, sweetheart, anything you choose.'
Does Olga's Lensky thus compose;
But I'll be mute. I don't propose
But soon she dropped her city pose:
Has still not mastered postal prose.
Or sparkling wit as cold as prose;
Then crossed the girl and mumbled verse.
Odessa's charms in splendid verse,
To mar the fleeting page with verse;
When in the parlour guests converse;
Nor any vulgar gutter verse,
Bring out your own or rent a horse,
When headlong and alone on horse
No funds on renting fresher horse,
He leaves abruptly, calls for horse,
Is incoherent rot, or worse;
There's no absurdity or worse,
Bewitched by moonlight's magic curse. . .
A partial viewthe poet's curse.
For other, colder dreams I nurse,
And with her wrinkled hand the nurse
'I'd be alone now . . . leave me, nurse.
And cursing woman's crooked course,
Which meant a longer trip of course;
And far from town now set your course!
She races down the meadow course,
Along the Petersburg chausse
To plead her elder sister's cause.
And so, dear reader, grant me pause
Elle tait fille, elle tait amoureuse.*
Afraid the scoundrel might refuse
But see . . . Oh, nanny, don't refuse!'
But then she took to keeping house
And almost even left her spouse;
Put silence cunningly to use,
Or laugh it off and, through some ruse,
Could answer keenly, be obtuse,
In all the sterile words they use
And Good and Evil, Life and Fate
Oh, much, too much you've stolen, Fate!
Of angry heirs in hot debate
'Farewell, my peaceful home and fate!
The servant maids would guess the fate
Zaretsky paces off their fate
The uncut story of your fate.
You've now resigned to him your fate.
And pondered my Zarma's* fate? . . .
And quite contented with his fate,
Became in time our young man's fate,
These days allotted me by fate . . 
* His peasants thanked their lucky fate,
And I surrender to my fate.
It came so close!. . . But now my fate
She entered the deserted gate.
Then sang me to the churchyard gate.
Monsieur l'Abb was shown the gate.
The ancient coach creeps out the gate.
Before a mansion's double gate.
A broken fence, a wicket gate,
Will on some future day relate
For two full hours; then, quite late
. Oppressive days indeed of late.
I like a sandy slope of late,
When he'd arrived, and if of late
I can't remember much of late.
The second night, the snow fell late.
I shed with you sweet tears too late;
But let it be: it's now too late 
As if encased in armoured plate.
And soon with ringing slabs of slate
Oh, come, Oh, come, I am thy mate!'
The wolf appears with hungry mate;
On each in turn they'd ruminate.
Within those empty halls ornate,
For scrutiny no less irate.
A quittent at a modest rate;
Who never risked his sound estate
Released to them the whole estate . . .
Were marked at home on their estate:
Contests obscenely our estate.
he'd been back home at his estate
To find herself at his estate. .. .
To reappear at his estate
Oh, Tanya, it's a sorry state;
In Muslim paradise complete,
Beneath a verse left incomplete,
Quite unadorned, her face gone white
Lies Moscow with its stones of white,
And hung the limbs of oaks with white;
The roofs, the yard, the fenceall white;
Or blush, or suddenly turn white .. .
An epigram of cunning spite
But just for show, as if to spite
Scarce mindful of their love or spite.
To look at life as at a rite,
Express himself and even write;
We're now no longer fit to write
But madrigals they'll have you write!
Then lead them to the duelling site;
The traveller's futile appetite;
On balls I madly used to dote:
Just sits with lowered head, remote;
Seem sweet as youthful sins remote,
Or for the passing of a note.
In crosses or a jotted note,
Four years consumptive, sad to note.
And stuff him with the play I wrote;
Or in the question mark he wrote.
Upon the letter that she wrote.
Or verse that Bogdanvich* wrote.
He did possess the happy forte
But that's enough. I must make haste
Beshtu,* the watchman of the waste;
'It's time she married . . . awful waste. . . .'
In dim Moldavia's vacant waste,
In current fashions of toilette,
No jealous lady trained lorgnette,
A curious and keen lorgnette
And 'neath it: toute vous Annette; 
Your frigid glance . . . that sermonette! . . .
This most unpleasant tte--tte;
But I, in love, was dense and mute.
Is always angry, sullen, mute
To burnand with the mind each minute,
An inn at every stage en route.
A coldly jealous, selfish brute!
And Christendom will institute
With just two balls and blunted cue.
The bailiff wrote as if on cue:
The foreword's here, if overdue.
And back at home she's overdue
His aged uncle's time was due.
Then asks her for the dance he's due.
And, cold himself, gave warmth its due.
Some imprecision of the tongue
Or frighten with despairing tongue.
Mere parody and just a rogue?
A lexicon of words in vogue . . .
The heavens sparkle now with blue;
Than all her friends in heaven's blue;
Can she have found the final clue?
Upon their buttercups of rue.
Tatyana's love is deep and true:
To former ways I'll still be true.
Her portrait there; it's charming, true;
To classicism I've been true:
Lest monde or husband misconstrue
When one fine day our grandsons true
Is just as meek and deaf, it's true,
Ah, blest indeed . . . although it's true,
And rather glad he was, it's true,
I would have asked youyes, it's true
To all this gossip; but it's true
He loved me and for me he gave
But somehow just the look he gave
What wings our first successes gave!
He bowed to her in silence, grave . . .
Then crowds its forebears toward the grave.
As he descended to the grave.
And think at my untimely grave:
It waxes, stirs, turns seething wave,
Why murmur vainly? He can't give
The happiness for which I live.'
The actual things that make it thrive,
And why for gold it need not strive,
Shy as a doe and apprehensive,
A wild creature, sad and pensive,
Finds even joy at times excessive,
When one gets old, life turns oppressive.'
Is neither cold nor too effusive;
She isn't hurried or obtrusive,
But now our minds have grown inactive,
Our novels too make vice attractive,
Use flattery as warm incentive,
How shrewdly he could be inventive
The jealous poet's mood turned festive!
He'd been, till now, uncertain. . . restive,
She bounded from the porch above
He pens a lyre . . . and then a dove,
With her old friend. 'My little dove,
'Oh, tell me, do, Tatyana love,
And rushed to greet her rhyming love
Of pistol, sword, and ready glove.
Adds colour lightly and with love;
I'm thinking of Onegin, love;
'Oh, let me be now . . . I'm in love.'
He did at last give up his love
Enough; get up. To you I owe
The world she loves and says goodbye:
And, scarce alive, cried out goodbye.
To talk once more and say goodbye.
Tatyana turns to say goodbye,
When only bareness greets the eye.
And mileposts soothe the idle eye
Presented him, with gloating eye,
Could gull a fool, and had an eye
Young Lensky came to cast an eye
With wicked grin or solemn eye
In fiery dust before her eye,
And sought in vain to catch her eye;
Poor Tanya's plight; but every eye
What's wrong with him? . . . He's in a daze.
What's stirring in that idle gaze,
Were sure to bring a mocking gaze
Beneath her parents' loving gaze,
His pistol with a level gaze.
Into the open field to gaze,
By bringing dreams before her gaze.
To catch your smile and search your gaze
The sacred dreams that fill your gaze,
Before their loyal subjects' gaze,
Will earn me an indulgent gaze,
Would oft recite, his eyes ablaze,
Amid his pleasures and their blaze,
Their youthful ravings and their blaze.
No, never midst the fiercest blaze
Then gives her hand a gentle squeeze;
In hopes that he (on charge) might squeeze
To honour, love, and idolize,
They're people whom we're bound to prize,
The fields are silver where they froze . ..
Just so a sapling sheds its leaf
A final and complete relief.
To render service, give relief;
Or brings her smothered tears relief;
From dream to dream a passage brief;
Although her tears were all too brief!
Prepared in trials or in grief
And proved unfaithful to her grief.
The way to master rampant grief;
Her heart is rent in two by grief.
And armed with your good staff, 
Darlings, then, let's scamper off, 
The charming sex is light as fluff.
And nature's made of wayward stuff
But now Didelot is boring stuff.'
The Flemish painter's motley stuff!
And yet I'll say on his behalf,
Against the rampart's granite shelf,
It's not your mind I'm talking of,
Who was it you were dreaming of?'
Quite sure he'll find Kavrin* pacing;
Once more he counts the hours, pacing;
He's off to Talon's,* late, and racing,
The clock strikes ten: and off he's racing,
A windmill there was squat-jig dancing
Tatyana woke and, idly glancing,
And cracked and waved its sails while prancing;
Next day as dawn was just advancing,
Elated by the music's bouncing,
His tea and rum at once renouncing,
Or gloomy Melmoth, lost and pleading,
That strikes him with such awful pleading?
But she ignores her sister's pleading,
Desires, dreams, and sorrows pleading
And yetalthough his eyes were reading,
He gave the message one quick reading,
Keeps leafing through some book she's reading,
Above some letter that she's reading
So stay beneath your roof... try reading:
Breaks out in mournful serenading.
Night falls; the moon begins parading
This tattered life of masquerading,
Are empty. ... I'd as soon be trading
Lord Byron, his caprice succeeding,
Then rage or drink. . . . Somehow proceeding,
And then by post Eugene was speeding,
Farewell, secluded place of hiding!
Through empty hall; then passes, gliding,
They're all aboard and, slowly gliding,
He enters like a dead man, striding
'She's mine!' announced Eugene, commanding;
The maid alone was left there standing
Once free, I seek again the blending
Her summer in the country mending
Or some young girl from town who's spending
The Muse appeared as love was ending
Than, down the sloping shoreline bounding,
No sooner would the cannon, sounding,
He who has lived as thinking being
And loathes this world with all her being;
He who can feel is always fleeing
Tatyana looks with eyes unseeing
I'm sure you'll find him most engaging
But I have no intent of waging
In bottle with the pitch still clinging,
(Alas, too salty); now they're bringing,
It's grey Filtievna, who's bringing
Enough, old boy, my ears are ringing!
To drive the cows outside with ringing;
It's where I find . . .''More pastoral singing!
Inside her hut a girl is singing,
But now her door is softly swinging:
Her gentle soul, athirst with aching;
And all the while her soul was aching,
And long he stood in sorrow aching;
And here's a household boy gone sleighing
All dressed since dawn, dead-pale and sighing,
That queen of secrets and of sighing.
But where's my rambling story rushing?
The wretched girl is scarcely breathing;
Inside her, stormy passion's seething;
Sees through a crack the strangest thing
The German baker's up and baking,
'Poor Yorick!' then he murmured, shaking,
He's master here, there's no mistaking;
And Tanya, now no longer quaking,
Then sudden hoofbeats! . . . Now she's quaking. . . .
Nay, ever more intensely quaking,
In pleasant hubbub morn's awaking!
She's reached the wood, the bear still tracking;
A jutting branch looms up, attacking,
In uniform? The one not talking . ..
Or what if he himself, not thinking,
Two slender, icebound poles lie linking
Some bagatelle when you'd been drinking;
And full of doubt, her spirits sinking,
Present me, do.''You must be joking!'
I'll see this Phyllis so provoking
'My left? But why? It seems like gawking.'
As were the arts of social dealing;
His blood by slow degrees congealing,
He should have spoken words of healing,
And all those beauties, once appealing,
She found a great deal more appealing;
And find the country unappealing; 
To monstrous looks and hellish squealing
The steaming blood poured forth, revealing
Eugene throws wide the door, revealing
The music's roar, the ballroom trembling,
I recollect the ocean rumbling:
Those rushing tides in tumult tumbling
Within a dream to which we cling,
Mad with regret and anguished feeling,
Yes, soon he lost all warmth of feeling:
He could have shown some spark of feeling
Devoid of any spark of feeling
But still, we welcome you with feeling.
He lay quite still and past all feeling;
Be thinking of... or merely feeling,
For she, in spite of family feeling,
Eugene fell down before her, kneeling;
'What ails you, Tanya?''Life's so trifling,
'I couldn't sleep ... #62038; nurse, it's stifling!
'My goodness, girl, you must be ailing;
But where his genius proved unfailing,
I have no leisure for retailing
I'm on the verge of tears and wailing!'
The marriage maker kept on calling
Only the sound of sentries calling,
The night grew still. . . with silence falling;
I got so scared . . . my tears kept falling;
Perhaps, when time had helped in quelling
Forgotten in his wretched dwelling,
In this forgotten country dwelling
Nor known this bitter heartache's swelling.
As others tell of passions swelling;
oor Lensky's muddled mind was swirling,
He found the manor fairly bustling
Both friends and foes had come ahustling,
The loge, where, beautiful and gleaming,
'Twas dusk; and on the table, gleaming,
And then a sudden thought came gleaming:
The fire goes out; the coal, still gleaming,
But now they're near. Before them, gleaming,
One constant wish forever gleaming,
I've closed my eyes to phantoms gleaming,
And all around her, dully gleaming,
Of fishermen were dimly gleaming.
Tatyana walked, alone and dreaming,
Yet distant hopes within me dreaming
Eugene stood lost in pensive dreaming
He knew one constant source of dreaming,
Far off Tatyana ranged in dreaming,
I liked his natural bent for dreaming,
But now it's late. Odessa's dreaming;
And what an awesome dream she's dreaming:
The merchant's youthful wife sits dreaming,
The sky all lightly veiled and streaming.
Its ancient domes and spires streaming
The rising vapours, faintly streaming,
It hissed and sent its vapour steaming
Lorgnette in hand and senses foaming,
My lyre sings! And in the gloaming
But I was born for peaceful roaming,
No sooner here than he went roaming,
His strangeness that was more than seeming,
He calls a sleigh as daylight's dimming;
His collar with its beaver trimming
But look, the crowd's astir and humming;
Ausonia's * happy sons are humming
Her voice more soft than reed pipe's humming:
The playful tune that keeps on drumming,
What's that... the crunching snow . . . who's coming?!
The hostess sees a lady coming,
Filled with his heart's regrets, and leaning
All tragico-hysteric moaning,
Had long since set Eugene to groaning:
The Latin vogue today is waning,
He had sufficient Latin training
And with its murky light defining
The place Eugene found so confining
And all the while the moon was shining
Where one who favoured soft reclining
His moment of revenge beginning,
Eugene, with secret malice grinning,
'Is he the same, or is he learning?
What tender and oppressive yearning
Scarce-breathing lips grow still with yearning,
From Gottingen with soulful yearning,
I love you with a tender yearning,
To all her groves and meadows, yearning
Her bosom heaves, her cheeks are burning,
In what new guise is he returning?
'For dreams and youth there's no returning;
Possesses me on spring's returning,
As with old friends, she keeps returning
Vladimir Lnsky, just returning
But then at last, as it was dawning,
With drooping head and frequent yawning,
'But tell me, what's your friend been doing?'
Then Olga's suitor came a-wooing.
Restored to home and its safekeeping,
Upon his neighbour's place of sleeping,
Still sniffling, coughing, hissing, clapping;
And while the people still are tapping,
Like any poetopen, caring,
At times attentive, then uncaring!
With epigrams of spite and daring
'The Larin place.''What reckless daring!
Because an ardent spirit's daring
By his pretentious, studied bearing:
She took it and with languid bearing
Forever modest, meek in bearing,
So circumspect, so strict in bearing,
Appears absurd or overbearing
Appear so proud or so forbearing,
The bard, whose modesty's endearing,
She can't make sense of what she's hearing,
Tatyana listens, scarcely hearing
And waits impatient in her clearing
The regimental band's appearing!
When dancing stars are disappearing
And as I watch them disappearing,
Upon her balcony appearing,
Good God, man, don't you find it wearing
'And how are our dear neighbours faring?
A traveller home from distant faring,
The horses neighed, their nostrils flaring,
A horde of monsters in a ring:
He sees the wilful Terek* roaring
He spies a stately eagle soaring,
The frozen corpse on sleigh, preparing
' 'Just half a glass, old boy, be sparing. . .
It's pleasant when you see him staring
But to the young its raptures bring
And starts to sing, off-key. Loud cheering
He's brought some news to set them cheering:
Creeps to the door and, softly peering,
Damns poetry for interfering
He offered her his arm. Despairing,
As storms refresh the fields of spring.
When captured by some boy in spring;
Some other and more ancient spring,
On top of which, they're so unerring,
Takes up his pen. . . . His verses ring
Lest I forget of whom I sing
Onegin then, while still not ceasing
I fear; And nowadays I find more pleasing
Their festive dinner all too pleasing,
Four fateful steps. The space decreasing,
He sees a youth, quite still, reposing
Her light chemise has slipped, exposing
Its worthlessness needs no professing,
So meanwhile, friends, enjoy your blessing:
The letter she would send caressing
Upon those feet these lips . . . caressing.
I longed to join the waves in pressing
She sighs . . . and in her soul possessing
With all the nonsense lovers sing;
The balls go in each bevelled housing.
While Petersburg, already rousing,
Half drowsing,
The gleaming pistols wake from drowsing.
Or that by morn they'd be debating,
That foggy book they're all debating,
Within her heart the frenzied beating
Like some grim shade of night's creating;
Of all that touches art or acting,
He's off!this critic most exacting
Yet in its mirror not reflecting
Diana's visagerecollecting
The poet's note about a 'meeting'.
Or sometimes merely bows on meeting,
But what ensued from Tanya's meeting?
Of but one thing, till our next meeting.
Or passes by without a greeting:
The latter, hard upon first greeting,
Might hear you speak a friendly greeting, 
Pours forth a maiden's blameless plighting.
And sings of Volga fishers, plaiting
His eyes ablaze, Eugene stood waiting
Sometimes a shepherd sits there waiting
The badge on those two maids-in-waiting,*
For which of them the grave lay waiting!
And here's a chap whose words are biting,
And propped upon an elbow, writing,
With tea too sweet to be inviting,
Was wondrous tender. If asserting
He'd only teased her with some flirting,
Sed alia temporal Such sporting
(With other capers such as courting)
Were fond of songs for fortune-casting,
Twice yearly too they did their fasting;
Eugene and he recalled the jesting,
Or else (and here I'm far from jesting),
Poor Lensky! In his place of resting,
I scare a flock of ducks from resting;
Her husband enters, thus arresting
#62038; when, my soul, with waves contesting,
Did he, sad bard, awake protesting
And caped in storms, shall I go questing
Those heady walks for which you're thirsting,
Load up your carriages to bursting,
A haughty skeleton sits pouting
Out of a dog-face horns are sprouting;
And friends and friendship less intriguing;
Inconstancy grew too fatiguing;
But now it's late and time for leaving.
And blind as ever, still believing,
Oh, blest is he who lives believing,
He felt it break with desperate grieving.
By joining him at least in grieving,
Yes, he was loved .. . beyond deceiving . . .
The North now howls, the winds are driving
And on the spice of malice thriving,
They laughed. Then guests began arriving.
The golden autumn now arriving.
Huge horns and bony fingers swerving
All hooves and trunksgrotesque and curving,
As mouths start chewing.
My Tanya's conquest taking wing,
Tatyana seeks some passage showing
Each pane a fragile pattern showing;
But now it's late. The winds are blowing,
He crammed his bookshelf overflowing,
And soon the fragrant tea was flowing
And long she stood, bewitched and glowing,
As Olga poured it, dark and glowing,
And all the hilltops soft and glowing
I might describe in terms more knowing
When scarce a boy and not yet knowing
Her dream disturbs her, and not knowing
He'd been entranced by Olga growing
Then read and readfrustration growing:
Your interest piqued and doubtless growing
And beats an iridescent wing
Where dawn's vermilion rays are playing;
There was a time when breezes playing
The rascal froze his fingers, playing,
And lighter than a swallow, saying:
A secret wreath that hung there swaying
Onegin's uncle, sick and dying,
And now with solemn mien, and dying
Or when I helped the poor and dying,
The day wore on, no word came flying.
And sure enough a note came flying;
The bottle pops as cork goes flying;
In heaven's peaceful desert flying,
Circassian steed on meadow flying;
By shaded cliff a camel lying,
And was it you I heard replying
While 'neath her downy pillow lying,
You'd start to weep, but all your crying
Or turned to heaven, softly crying,
Instead, her silken sash untying,
So judge yourself what we'd be buying,
The squires face each other wheezing;
But all that foamy, frothy wheezing
On melting snowas if he's dozing
Her head is bowed, as if she's dozing;
The Girls' Song
And girls prefer 'The Kitty's Song.'*
Would take my merry Muse along
A lonely boat would sail along,
Foretells a death to come ere long,
At least one note to linger long,
Has lasted thirty centuries long!
That's five and twenty cantos long!
To read to her for whom you long:
To whom amid the jealous throng
A simple Russian family throng;
For starters (tell me if I'm wrong),
And then I'll write this world a song
As you, great Homer, you whose song
Strike you up a rousing song, 
While far away some rousing song
As heeding passion's siren song
Do you today devote your song?
The very object of your song,
Recalling, like some friend, my song.
And playfully astound the young,
Within this breast no longer young;
That dangerous and sad pariah,
His mind, still vacillant in reach
Tatyana listened to him preach.
And I so meekly heard you preach?
And raven locks of shoulder reach.
And she my willing lips will teach
Onegin's taste in horse and coach.*
Grow flustered when she saw his coach;
He thought she'd blush with self-reproach,
While in the yard their men reproach
It's my turn now to make a speech.
An always bold, impassioned speech,
Scarce breathing and bereft of speech,
Both love's and Petrarch's ardent speech.
Indeed the poet's fervent speech,
The one we sing to will be rich
Above a tambour to enrich
Her same old spouse, and same old pooch
Petrarch
Young Lensky seemed the perfect catch;
They asked him round and sought to match
They spade up silver from a ditch!
A linen cloth with silken stitch.
Had choked her maiden breast too much:
In passing that I speak as much
Still has her friend, Monsieur Finemouch,
Her soul awaited . .. someone's touch.
Of feasts and foods and corks and such
Creates a passage with his sleigh;
Along the Neva's bank by sleigh.
A pistol, cocked and lifted high,
Off where the grass grows dense and high,
And there, where southern waves break high,
A waxing crescent moon on high,
And 'neath the misty moon on high
Amid those mournful crags on high,
One aims a gun at ducks on high;
To aim at temple or at thigh.
She flits on tiptoe with a sigh
And mourned his ashes with a sigh.
Out to the open fields to sigh;
Though not without a heartfelt sigh,
While thinking under every sigh:
there stands a cross beneath a bough.
All weeds. No wreath is on the bough;
(We say 'romantically'although,
As I approached the farm . . . Enough!
'I've suffered ballets long enough,
The old was dated through and through,
Who'll never bore us through and through?
And grandly you'll see winter through!
He waits till the mazurka's through,
May do me in before it's through.'
Prepared to conjure all night through,*
And mornings read some book right through. . . .
And by the window read it through.
The game of billiards, all day through,
To gloss a common epigraph,
The driver sits behind the dash
Of naked linden, birch, and ash
The beams from heaven's lanterns flash;
In sheepskin coat and scarlet sash.
But not today. Although I cherish
All that a poet's soul might cherish:
My dear one, you are doomed to perish;
To see how he may wane or flourish,
Oblivion when tempests flourish,
But first in dazzling hope you nourish
Her heart consumed with lasting anguish?
She'll wonder too: 'Did Olga languish?
Or sultry breast on which to languish.
Was I so racked with yearning's anguish:
The rutted snow had turned to slush;
And, whistling, fires with a rush.
A hunter hidden in the brush
But where in such a headlong rush
The youngbloods' yarns of courting death.
Will strain to hear with bated breath
And pledge of life beyond this earth!
Of neighbours' feasts and rounds of mirth;
That Cleopatra of the North;
But even Nina, shining forth
I too there used to saunter forth,
But found it noxious in the north.*
You cherished dreams of sacred worth
Eugene alone could see his worth;
Was in his primea handsome youth
And is there no return of youth?
And so he killed eight years of youth
Compares with our own fading youth,
And poet filled with Kantian truth.
For which no spring will come, in truth?
And lost life's very bloom, in truth.
Shall I be thirty soon, in truth?
The one-time corsair, Morali*
* * * Ennui! . . .
So what's ahead? Ennui, ennui! .. .
Become good friends from sheer ennui.
La sotto i giorni nubilosi e brevi,
As your dear waist, my sweet Zizi,*
Just looked at himher visage bleak
In fact. . . Good Lord, my wits are bleak!
She finds all former pleasures bleak.
(Of verses I won't even speak);
And everyone who chose to speak
She shuddered, but she didn't speak,
She's pale and wasted, doesn't speak!
She wants to scream . . . but cannot speak;
Called him a menace and a freak.
Our taste in names is less than weak
She tries to flee . . . but feels too weak;
A Muscovite in Harold's cloak,
His pistols; then he put them back.
These creatures then would lure him back!
Some fruit liqueurs and applejack,
His feelings and his thoughts went slack,
Until Triquet, who had a knack
Dealt out her motley faro pack.
And under heels parquet would crack;
A book of Schiller's from the rack;
Its thunder once could even rack
With stern behaviour's grim attack,
To keep his wicked tongue in check,
And thought: What foolishness to wreck
Of all desire at length grown sick,
But disenchanted just as quick,
But pantaloons, gilet, and frock
Sat nanny in her quilted cassock;
And drops of tears . . . while on a hassock,
These words are hardly Russian stock;
Immersed in thickly oozing muck.
Odessa's flooded, drowned, and stuck,
Armenian, Spaniard, Frenchman sleek,
You'll meet the haughty Slav, the Greek,
You've been invited there next week!'
Where he and Tanya had their talk.
Where he and she once had their talk.
That dusky, linden-shaded walk
And so let's hasten to the walk
Or that I now have wealth and rank;
To circles that you find more swank;
You dropped in twice and closed the book;
Two Petriads,* a grammar book,
A glance in any other book.
An aged uncle'sin my book;
And noting how poor Tanya shook,
With Olgaall confused and shook
That momentary tender look,
Or judge yourself how it must look
He barely hid his angry look
There too, within a shaded nook,
A distant and secluded nook
Within a cool and leafy nook.
By ancient lindens near the brook,
A simple stone adjoins the brook.
By lonely fields and burbling brook,
Beside a limpid flowing brook,
Bemused and muddled, his own rook.
Where Lensky with his pawn once took,
And in exchange he also took
The busy master never took
And walked the boy in Letny Park.*
But all seems joyless, bleak and dark;
Gone silent and forever dark.
He seldom punished any lark,
Not even in some chance remark;
The languid mind will find no spark,
Now gazes at the vacant park. ...
Inside itall is hushed and stark,
A Quaker? Bigot?might one ask?
Or will he sport some other mask?
And stirs in me, I won't conceal,
Upon the modish word 'ideal'
Your candour has a great appeal
Vladimir gently dozed for real;
A laudable and worthy goal.
Inside the pans. Screwed fast to metal,
And soon the square grows gay and vital.
Martyn Zadck cannot dispel;
A proper challenge or cartel: 
To see that flirt before the duel.
Convinced that Olga's heart was cruel,
Out to the mill, where each would level
He's ever constant, ever novel;
Before no critic will he grovel,
In time, I promise, I'll not fail
It's time, it's time! I bid her hail;
For hair and teeth and fingernail.
And beckon to each passing sail.
May I present, as we set sail,
To tell you all in full detail.
Amid his feasts to no avail?
Sad mist and murky gloom prevail;
A victim draped in lavish veil. . . .
The room where fashion's model pupil
Escape unscathed ... the slippery devil!
To paint a Petersburg grand ball;
In hired coach towards the ball.
On leaving some delightful ball,
Like Chatsky,* straight from boat to ball.
He drives to bed from last night's ball,
At masquerade or midnight ball.
On Christmas eve, he paid a call:
In man's attire to pay a call
Then others too must heed the call.
Immersed in gloom beyond recall,
The ghost of days beyond recall;
With olden days beyond recall,
As bitter losses we recall;
(In Chapter One, if you recall),
She made her weekly bathhouse call,
Oh, hearken to my woeful call:
Just casual friends who'd often call
They dropped him cold and ceased to call.
Why did you ever come to call?
Responding to our journals' call,
But we have lots of neighbours call,
The world's fresh glitter and its call
My soul's a stranger to its call;
Where will he make the night's first call?
Answers the drumbeat's duty call.
The maids have gathered, one and all,
They took offence and, one and all,
The cooks make lunch for one and all;
Then beds are made; the guests are all
Neglected bridges rot and fall;
Of leaves that perished in the fall,
She pickled mushrooms for the fall,
For hearty talk at evenfall,
So he returned one day to fall,
He married off his son this fall.
Arises, ripens, and must fall;
Your tears in fact would only gall.
Assigned their roomsfrom entrance hall
With folded arms, along the hall,
'Come to my golden chamberhall!'
With humble roots and servants' hall;
Oh, never mindhe'll make them all.
For I'm not worthy of them all.
I couldn't even count them all.'
And somewhat pale, too thin and small,
Within his soul must hold men small;
The view outdoorsthe lunar pall,
Yet not replaced you after all?
Still held his youthful mind in thrall;
With grammar may delight us all,
But on the whole, not bad at all;
I'd not have known you then at all,
But read no Cicero at all
Won't let the traveller sleep at all.
She pays no heed to guests at all,
Would fail to touch my heart at all,
And hasten rather to forestall
Lord Byron's portrait on the wall,
Inside our Lyce* garden wall
For marriage bonds or wedding bell,
The bee flies out from waxen cell
Inside that modish bachelor cell.
To claim its meed from field and dell.
It's cold and dark within the dell.
That work of heaven or of hell,
She stepped inside the empty shell
Retainers crowd the gate pell-mell
Into the fields, my friends, pell-mell!
Nor foreign beauties' magic spell,
My gentle Muse's magic spell
Has brought defective steeds to sell;
Who'd ask for more? The world could tell
Which is to say that he could tell
The frightful vision must foretell
Now tea is brought. I like to tell
And then at thirty, married well,
Where once our hero used to dwell.
Fare thee well, and if for ever, Still for ever, fare thee well.
To bid their mistresses farewell.
The chance to know Onegin well.
That angel. . . and proud fiend as well.
And fled afar . . . and she as well.
The breeder from the steppe as well
That he had wit and charm as well.
Eight rubbers; and eight times as well
And soft seductive nights as well.
Nor pleasure's rounds, nor learning's well,
Who was at twenty fop or swell,
It called him out and did it well.
And economics he knew well;
What role does he intend to fill?
And women reapers come to fill
And cannot ever read my fill.
Life's essence . . . and enjoyed my fill.
I'd much prefer words harsh and chill,
Or Freischutz* played with timid skill
Of steady labour made him ill,
He drinksall drink and all grow shrill;
The Muse first came to make me thrill.
The moonlight shines upon her sill.
A country house ... a windowsill. . .
She sits before the windowsill.
I'm . . . you know, nurse ... in love, not ill.'
If you recall your Tanya still,
The darkness wanes, but Tanya still
You're burning up!''Oh, do be still,
Amid the tumult and the still,
Near waters sparkling in the still,
And strength of mind were working still,
By fingers that are learning still.
Where she sits waiting . . . waiting still!
And with a spirit never still,
The goal of life, he found, was still
Her husband at the time was still
Good night.' She's now alone. All's still.
And reverently I guard it still;
Or does he play the outcast still?
He frownsand all of them grow still.
And nothing issued from his quill;
Who haunts your thoughts and writer's quill,
With such a lively mind and will,
The doubts that plagued his heart and will;
To faint; but deep within her, will
Her fiancagainst her will!
And there the ploughman rests at will
Your tears and rhymes and what-you-will?
The little girl with docile doll
Down to the stream below the knoll.
Her walks were long; a brook or knoll
And, lightly clad, would take a stroll
This dreadful ailment's heavy toll;
Prepares in play for protocol,
As did the skeptical old fool,
(Faublas'* disciple and his tool),
To keep her fury in control!
She finds a brother's slayer hateful
She'll never see him . . . and be grateful,
While never meaning to be spiteful;
More wondrous still and still more fearful:
Aware of snow, his nag is fearful,
On goose's neck a skull seemed cheerful,
Ah, wintertime! . . . The peasant, cheerful,
That your good friend won't find delightful,
Within those waves each martyred soul
But now a kind and simple soul
Except to charm her thirsting soul.
We call it simply Russian soul. 
And face to face with his own soul,
Onegin stares with all his soul:
The emptiness that plagues his soul
I cannot resurrect my soul.
And then, good God, she starts to bawl:
Or scholar in a yellow shawl!
The wenches and the drivers brawl.
Was carping at the millstone's cam.
Vladimir waited near the dam;
In silver curves begins to gleam.
Was this that girl... or did he dream?
He lived, he breathed one single dream,
To Olga like some dreadful dream.
As in a dreadful senseless dream,
Above the mist. And now the stream
And wet the metal bit with foam,
And woods where once I used to roam!
How self-oblivious he could seem!
The endless dance had come to seem
That little girl whose warm esteem
She cannot raise her eyes to face them
Across from Tanyathere they place them;
Since, after all, I'm one of them.
And later secretly demean them
Or else he'd patch things up between them
A grizzled Kalmuk came to meet them;
She called from parlour couch to greet them.
But now the chime and watch alert them:
Another round would hardly hurt them,
Which might in turn bring you some claim
And we now press our wilful claim
And yet, I think, I'd wish to claim
But cherishing your friendship's claim,
Alas! His fiance has scorned him
My poor, poor Lensky! Yes, she mourned him;
Theocritus and Homer bored him,
But reading Adam Smith restored him,
But sleep had hardly come to take him
His neighbour, calling out to wake him:
What clever traps he'd set before him!
And how his wicked tongue would gore him!
Dared clean his nails in front of him, 
But will he come? .. . She doesn't hear him.
She trembles, burns, and waits ... so near him!
One thought within his heart enfolds him:
But only one bright image holds him,
Without a word the lady shuns him!
Sees her at once! Her harshness stuns him!
And countless tearsthe gentle balm
A thousand walks in evening's calm
Could not conceive how solemn Grimm*
And brilliant day begin to bloom;
Our sage of eighteen summers' bloom.
A noisy swarm, to meadow bloom.
A painful joy that lifts her gloom
With him amid the frosty gloom.
And all the monsters fled the room;
At everything around the room;
All this adorned his dressing room,
The crowd moves on to drawing room:
And like the family circle's charm;
And, though immune to reading's charm,
'The boredom, brother, there's the harm.'
But still, in books he saw no harm,
In saturnine romanticism.
Cloaked even hopeless egotism
And then there's Southern sun and ocean . . .
Like smoke across an azure ocean.
'But, sweetheart, I've grown old ... I mean . . .
Where maybe, reader, you began,
Of bonneted Academician
Their daughters with this semi-Russian.
Has never been expressed in Russian;
That Tanya'd finally found a man;
'Old X is quite a splendid man.'
Dame Larin muttered with a moan.
And I must die without a moan. 
Drew forth his flute's first ardent moan.
Was born beside the Neva's span,
Of whom lifelong the verdict ran:
And soon the general verdict ran,
The charming line: 'belle Tatyan.'*
In this serene and glory-laden
And locked him in a darkened den.
With choral songas they'd been bidden
They've passed away or changed unbidden ...
Quite other lines that rose unbidden
To eat the master's fruit when hidden,
Whatever feelings then lay hidden
Between the printed lines lay hidden
Who'd dare to seek the tender maiden
He locked himself within his den
'Who would have thought?' 'How long it's been!'
She seemed the same she'd always been.
And truffles, youth's delight so keen,
There was a time when I was keen,
In maidens' albums, thought it keen
Mere sight of them brings on the spleen.*
What is itmartyred pride, or spleen
And in a letter, rash and green,
In springtime on the meadow's green,
And driven home to change and preen.
Their albums too you must have seen,
While on the flames he'd drop unseen
Beneath the table barely seen,
That no young girl thirteen,
From frontside, backside, in between.
Above the lonely sea . . . and then
Cries out from sleep Encore!and then
Could say a word to you; and then, 
I used to meet with now and then:
And so you're off. . . forgive me then.
I thought she might accept him then;
To lose my hateful freedom then.
We sometimes like to listen then
Was sleeping soundly even then.
Had seized him by the collar then,
But lead them to the altar then.
Fly to the Neva's water then,
Where is it better, then?'
Pelting him with cherries then, 
From old Anisya. Next day then,
To close one eye and, only then,
But tell me Lensky, how and when
To take his aim. . . . And that was when
I turned to flame, I felt all shaken, 
How deep his stricken heart is shaken!
Eugene stared down at Lensky, shaken.
She left him then. Eugene, forsaken,
Now Tanya is alone, forsaken!
But finally she rose, forsaken,
As one whom love had left forsaken,
In anguish, with his heart forsaken,
Though pleased with the revenge he'd taken,
The day ahead all planned and taken:
But hardly had she turned and taken
And long she watched the road they'd taken,
My span on earth is all but taken, 
Onegin, who was widely taken
I need to know when I awaken, 
Felt all his old ennui awaken,
When you came in, I seemed to waken, 
By afternoon he'll finally waken,
Neath passion's rains they green and thicken,
Their downy green and start to thicken.
And Lensky falls; the shadows thicken;
Renew themselves with joy, and quicken;
The heated words grow louder, quicken;
The vales grow dry and colours quicken;
There's no one here to whom I've spoken, 
And in your coming, God has spoken, 
In wedlock we would both be broken.
My mind and will are almost broken, 
My life till now has been a token 
Believe me (conscience be your token):
But now blue evening starts to darken,
The great Rossini there to harken,
And pain has made us humble men
E sempre bene, gentlemen.
Beneath the waves, while older men
Much bolder than most healthy men,
He chose with trembling hand to pen
And, with a yawn, took up his pen
With his enraptured poet's pen
Or even Demon of my pen!*
And picture truly with my pen
To feed the critics' hungry pen.
But who is that among the chosen,
Can't see her fields and valleys glisten:
Rouse Tanya from her bed to listen.
A roguish rhyme to tease the smitten.
By thoughts of fame and freedom smitten,
Some army scribbler will have written
What odes indeed he might have written,
Onegin lived in his own heaven:
But when he reached his uncle's haven,
He was preparedlike any craven
In summer he'd get up by seven
Vexation? Pride? Or youth's old yen
The youthful lover with his yen
That figure standing mute and frozen,
Revive my hopes with but a sign, 
'Who loves you more than I must sign
Is dressed, undressed, and dressed again?
The cock hails Vesper once again;
To see the empty house again;
For all the cares of love again?
I dared not trust in love again:
But no! the deal fell through again.'
For just one day seek youth again.
Eugene (to speak of him again),
Emits a yawn and snores again.
I'll make them quarrel yet again,
Could dream both day and night again 
Would chase sweet vanity again.
And neither distance, nor the chain
Sits gazing at the darkened plain.
Alas! Upon life's furrowed plain
Kept lessons light and rather plain;
And managed somehow to remain.
Will claim what happy days remain.
He honoured too, in tears and pain,
Just love yourself and ease the pain,
To spare his charge excessive pain,
He sang of parting and of pain,
eem cast in gloom or mute with pain,
Poor Tanya, sleepless and in pain,
Disturbed her soul and caused her pain,
She murmured something through her pain
One ever-present cause for pain!
Oh, blest is he who joins his pain
Another's joy, another's pain,
Of something vague, of mists and rain;
For after all he couldn't drain
And maddened pangs of love's refrain.
With sweetly flaming love's refrain,
She whispers in a soft refrain
For long . . . forever. In his train
However great her shock or strain,
From head to toe, the slightest strain
negin, do you still retain
But neither did her form contain,
She's spread herself through field and fountain,
Like verse with prose, like flame with fountain:
And so they metlike wave with mountain,
She lies atop the farthest mountain
She lies there sleepless and uncertain;
In bed, beneath her silken curtain,
Why spend your efforts all in vain;
He trembles, hunts for words in vain:
Conceal his hopes, play jealous swain,
And fresh new linen from the bin.
And from the hut come cries and din;
To face them; and amid the din,
A stranger who had wandered in.
That paying visits does me in;
Till father blessed me and gave in.
A novel in the older vein
Onegin turned to Lensky next: 'Shall we begin?'
'Sit down.. . . How strange! ... I can't begin . . .
And talk all day once they begin.
Tatyana's Letter to Onegin
Then all the crowd comes pouring in
He's yours, he'll say, through thick and thin:
But still Onegin lies within
He loves you so! . . . Why, you're like kin!
Tatyana seemed among her kin
And straightway too, to all her kin
Is surer far than friends or kin:
Of kennels, and of distant kin,
For two whole weeks to see my kin,
While muffled by the violin
The more we draw a woman in,
Never come to listen in
As did derivative Knyazhnin;
Their tendency to just drop in
And gusting snowflakes flash and spin,
Within the witching webs we spin.
To watch the brilliant ballroom spin.
The wives their jealous gossip spin.
Survives when even tempests spin.
The humble sinner Dmitry Larin
He was a kind and simple barin,
So frisky-carefree with her grin,
We're put to sleep by talk of 'sin';
His French valet, Guillot, runs in
The bear proclaims: 'My gossip's in.'
All cross themselves and dig right in.
Of liquor, and of hay brought in,
And even there it seems to win.
The daring satirist Fonvizin,
Of writerswhom I won't condemn
That semi-light, so pale and solemn,
Commotion, bows . . . the glad, the solemn . . .
Between two aunts, beside a column,
The iron bust* upon its column
Our Academic Lexicon.
The lakeway path, the wood; and on
'It's time to rise! Past six . . . come on!
Looks back and answers: 'Agafon.'*
She runs . .. but he keeps crashing on . . .
Ah yes, he loved in such a fashion
I'd have you with your art refashion
And so, in slow but growing fashion
To mock in such a casual fashion
Her heart; as if in awful fashion
He dropped you too in sudden fashion.
Stern censure in your former fashion
To talk to them of clothes or fashion
In such an honest, artless fashion?
A trusting soul in callous fashion.
Her heart speaks out in urgent fashion
Her head bent down in modest fashion,
They fluff her curls in latest fashion,
And so your mistress (faithful minion)
For jibes .. . and all his foul dominion.
Throughout that barren, dim dominion
What's more, the husband's frank opinion
So there it isthe mob's opinion!
And Lensky formed a low opinion
The slightest hope that on occasion
And now I seize the first occasion
I first tried silence and evasion; 
He shuts the book and, with decision,
Takes up his stand in indecision.
I wait for you . . . and your decision: 
At thirty steps with fine precision,
What wicked and deserved derision 
Alas, with well-deserved derision!
And feverish with lyric vision,
And even now, my dearest vision,
Is it perhaps my new ascension
Eugene, with friendly condescension,
Remained beyond her comprehension,
He enters in some apprehension;
And, maybe, secret apprehension
Like ancient foes in mad dissension,
The princess, to his added tension,
At home receives him without tension;
At tender love's still timid passion;
Because she heeds the call of passion
A maiden's foreign words of passion
Apostate from the storms of passion,
To this offensive show of passion,
Perhaps an ancient glow of passion
As only poets, mad with passion,
A lancer whom she loves with passion;
Then bowing to innate compassion,
'But death from him is sweet compassion.
More clearly nowthank Godher passion
And in the solitude her passion
But dolls were never Tanya's passion,
It's hard to face a long succession
Each pair a blur in quick succession,
For several minutes in succession
Before the hostess in succession,
Monotonous and mad procession,
To sit and watch the grand procession
Like spectres in a bleak procession.
And trail the seemly crowd's procession
She takes no note of dawn's procession,
The brilliant madcap of confession.
The poet, feasting on confession,
Description, though, is my profession;
Rousseau (permit me this digression)
The course of youthful love's progression
He got so lost in his depression,
Nor does she put her seal's impression
That figure with the strange expression?
Upon the lady whose expression
Or else turned poet (an obsession
Gone blind with tears, in full submission,
Mark how the world compels submission:
And sterner cares now seek admission;
All other days they've our permission
But, taking leave, requests permission
And so she turned for love's discussion
He'd calland right away discussion
His soul still knew the warm effusion
Some future dunce with warm effusion
He lays a hand, as in confusion,
Then Olga enters in confusion,
And many more. But her confusion
On yielding rugs in rich profusion;
In search of pleasure's sweet profusion;
The manor house, in proud seclusion,
Of glory, country, proud seclusion.
He fell in love with dark seclusion,
In philosophical seclusion
I'll float in gondola's seclusion;
And fled the woods' and fields' seclusion,
While Fate intends no grand conclusion. . . .
Well, this was my Eugene's conclusion.
Of every raging mad delusion,
For this may all be mere illusion,
(And does so still, have no illusion)
Farewell, #62038; golden games' illusion!
Perhaps (a flattering hope's illusion!)
Sad times to come and disillusion.
He left his home in disillusion
As yet unmarked by disillusion
Unbidden guests for their intrusion;
Screened by a hill from wind's intrusion,
Express not pain, but death's intrusion.
Dedication*
Lacking the fervent dedication
I face another complication:
Had pictures of domestication
His favourite sport or avocation:
Nor yet the Muse, his true vocation,
A charming fool at love's vocation,
When we have broadened education,
We've all received an education
And Tanya sees with trepidation
I watch with jealous trepidation
His heart grown deaf to commendation
For now they'll seek accommodation
#62038; Adriatic! Grand Creation!
Some favourite author's fond creation:
This noble and profound creation
His only form of recreation
Another! No! In all creation 
My spirit's own newborn creation!
The next dance too. In God's creation!
The fleeting works of my creation,
Triquet stands up; the congregation
At fifty shed all obligation
Eugene, detesting litigation
Nor bowed her head in subjugation;
She blushes in appreciation,
Of usage and pronunciation;
It has, I know, association
Their tears of reconciliation;
He woke to find, with some elation,
He sought them out with no elation
With Tanya's aunt, a kind relation
At this unwanted revelation.
For their sweet flow of revelation,
She saw it all. In desolation,
To shed a tear in desolation
She roams in aimless desolation,
Tatyana pined in isolation;
To show them in their isolation,
Young maidens find quick consolation
Refused, he found quick consolation;
There's nothing offers consolation
Eugene, once left to contemplation
We drank in silent contemplation
To find an adequate translation
Without a doubt a full translation
And yield my rights to love's translation. . . .
As people say without translation,
Alone, and sunk in calculation,
'You have been out of circulation.
For long enough. Congratulation
A word of candid explanation.
Onegin, late, made explanation.
Avoiding further explanation,
But no, she can't. What explanation? . . .
Compassion, noble indignation,
And fumed in sullen indignation;
Without surprise or indignation.
Consumed with jealous indignation,
And meantime, feigning resignation,
Implored me, and in resignation
A lover's secret assignation . . .
With what a vivid fascination
While in his mind Imagination
Come stir the bleak imagination,
To cheer the dark imagination
And then her warm imagination
Long since her keen imagination,
And had, it's true, no inclination
But no one knew her inclination
Although Onegin's inclination
Her lips express determination
Now home's our heroes' destination,
The heavens chose my destination 
What hitter scorn and condemnation 
He did exempt from condemnation
Ignoring reason's condemnation,
Why not? I like its intonation;
Zaretsky frowned in consternation:
But roads are bad now in our nation;
So thank the Lord that in this nation
For nowadays in our great nation,
Exulting in anticipation,
Falls silent in anticipation.
Each has his own preoccupation,
At first he'd beg a declaration,
I'm writing you this declaration
Of endless years of separation,
As at a vexing separation,
Who cooled off love with separation
Their jealous torments, separation,
'Tatyana's name-day celebration
His mournful life in consecration! . . .
To forest green and liberation,
A harvest brief, each generation,
But where's distress? Commiseration?
With gaze of keen commiseration
And feel a deep commiseration;
But lit instead a conflagration.
Before the star's disintegration,
Accept my thanks and admiration,
The fine and noble aspiration
Warmed by the god of inspiration,
And send these fruits of inspiration
'Whose gaze, evoking inspiration,
This heart still throbbed with inspiration;
When, filled once more with inspiration,
And you, my youthful inspiration,
His gaze of constant inspiration,
He fed on hope's eternal ration;
With his Ochkov decoration!*
Whose form, in pensive adoration,
To long to clasp in adoration
And now with what great concentration
She seems the very illustration
(Like fashion's very illustration)
He never knew, to our frustration,
One moment backa breath's duration
And then they ask, in compensation
By fate's mysterious dispensation,
But then as torpor dulled sensation,
Produced at large a great sensation
And hold a placid conversation!. . .
What's that? Just that. Mere conversation
Great charm to private conversation;
Been weak at Russian conversation?
Who's standing there in conversation
Where two old friends in conversation
Let's listen to their conversation
He smiled at Lensky's conversation.
Attends their giddy conversation
(I'm fond of friendly conversation
Of free and easy conversation,
Compendium of affectation,
Or use those sorts of affectation
With silence and in meditation:
Consumed by bitter meditation,
And keep to silent meditation;
She gave no hint of agitation:
She'd hurry and, in agitation,
And fame's delicious agitation
From pangs of jealous agitation;
Long since her heart's sweet agitation
Where now the ardent agitation,
What was he then? An imitation?
(And Olga too!) an invitation;
Prince N. had sent an invitation.
Another bard in exaltation
'But I'm not made for exaltation:
That with a secret exultation,
Or do we mark with lamentation
To see the day!" ' ... In lamentation,
But mother with her lamentation
Pour out confessions, lamentation,
Meanwhile . . . Onegin's presentation
Where fate once willed our confrontation,
For but one moment held temptation
Or hell's own demon of temptation?
Your virtues are a vain temptation,
I didn 't yield to sweet temptation
And once, when riding battle station,
Another ballroom king on station
She saw no friendly soul on station
Each day he rides to take his station
And leave him, reader, at his station. . .
On Sundays at his window station,
Bedbugs and fleas at every station
Capricious belles of lofty station!
ut vale in a salutation;
Great wealth and rank and reputation;
He'd earned a certain reputation
(By scientific computation,
I liked his caustic disputation
He ceased to know infatuation,
However much the situation
Speak out on Tanya's situation:
But if my hapless situation 
With no great sense of deprivation;
Are you my angel of salvation
God grant his mortal soul salvation,
How nature's lively renovation
With us the word's an innovation,
In passing, though, one observation:
The kind of thought or observation
Tatyana listened with vexation
So hear me through without vexation:
And left them too without vexation,
It's true: by self-hypnotic action,
But what was Tanya's stunned reaction
And what would be your own reaction
Whatever, reader, your reaction,
Onegin, with his first reaction,
So thus he failed to join the faction
Quite curtly offered satisfaction
I hope we part in satisfaction. . .
A cause for solemn satisfaction,
Who'd killed his friend for satisfaction,
Annoyed with leisure and inaction,
A youthful friend for some infraction:
Because we take mere talk for action,
My muddled pupil, in distraction,
He took up travel for distraction,
Soon proved a wearisome attraction.
The hero of our novel's action!
And tried to write. But art's exaction
They send you greetings and affection. . . .
But here let's honour with affection
He'd shared her frolics with affection.
A little maiden's meek affection
Another captured her affection,
My faith in you and your affection; 
She never learned to show affection,
The young man's blissful, brief infection;
For him enchantment's deep infection
* Thus you, Yazykov,* with perfection,
Oh, God, my friend, what sheer perfection
So let him meanwhile live his life Believing in the world's perfection;
Another with his love's perfection
One worthy of your soul's perfection,
What answer came? Just stern rejection.
Mute monument to fond reflection:
His endless bent for deep reflection,
He lacked, it's true, all predilection
She lacked the slightest predilection,
But knew by heart a fine collection
Is gone; the snake of recollection
And on the leaves of recollection,
Sweet elegies, whose full collection
But let it be. Take this collection
And steer for now a new direction,
And beg you for your kind protection. 
Beneath a shady park's protection
Time was, with grave and measured diction,
To mend my ways in deeds and diction,
Believed in dreams and card prediction,
The hero in his work of fiction
At times he reads her works of fiction
And then maintain the shameless fiction
#62038; charming feet and mad affliction!
Whose author's powers of depiction
As if today, through some restriction,
Tatyana heeded with conviction
This might well seem an indiscretion,
The cunning of a base ambition
He felt a restless, vague ambition,
What sombre echoes of ambition
Of youthful springtime's vast ambition,
And, following the old tradition,
Those twelfthtide eves, by old tradition,
And so, by countryside tradition,
Well-off. . . and handsome in addition,
When our old roads' decayed condition
(A most unfortunate condition
Concealing her wrought-up condition,
And nameless pangs and sweet perdition . . .
Will change beyond all recognition.
For every social admonition;
Thus spake Eugene his admonition.
God spare me from the apparition,
How sad I find your apparition,
Did I not see your apparition
And rightly so: in inquisition,
Their chilly pride in high position,
My pen has lost its disposition
She likes the stately disposition
He found much wrong in his position:
I fear that in this meek petition
Of both young girls with superstition;
And apropos, I might make mention
Concerning Olga, that he'll mention;
But all they ever seem to mention
An episode too slight to mention,
And tell him that he's not to mention
Vladimir hasn't heart to mention
All poets, I need hardly mention,
Tatyana's soul. His true intention
And now, malignant in intention,
The poet, lost in hot contention,
Why mark me out for your attention?
Whatever comes to his attention
I too have gazed in rapt attention
Once more in solemn, rapt attention
She pays him not the least attention,
I'm trying hard to pay attention;
Tatyana tries to pay attention
And when Eugene drew my attention,
His pen breathes love, not pure invention
In these odd lines of my invention
No madrigals of mere convention
I too had parted with convention,
And he recalled with grim emotion,
But why succumb to grim emotion?
Had Lensky known the deep emotion
My deep respect for your emotion,
'Back thenfar off from vain commotion,
Pursued him through the world's commotion,
Or had Tatyana had some notion
Remembers him; his bride's devotion
Your trusting soul. . . and sweet devotion.
You had no use for my devotion . . .
'Your elegy lacks all perception,
' One might to this take sharp exception,
When just the master's least suggestion. . . .'
'Oh, nanny, please, that's not the question,
With something of his true complexion
Your verse's limpid, live complexion,
A glutton, grafter, and buffoon.
As infant slumber, as the moon
The cattle low; and by the moon
And read the future by the moon.
All ancient folklore night and noon,
A rogue and gossip night and noon,
They'd meet on horse each afternoon,
But then their friendship grew, and soon
I have of old relied upon
Byron
To exercise restraint and reason,
Would stop her now for no good reason
Take walks? The views give little reason,
Like modish verse devoid of reason,
For one may be a man of reason
And gave the neighbours equal reason
He didn't die, or lose his reason,
Enchanted land! There for a season,
Why argue vainly with the season?
To bud anew each vernal season.
But how is one, in this dull season,
And all that final summer season
The days flew by. The winter season
And yet a trip in winter season
Another squire chose this season
Just picks her up and rushes on;
'Oh, what's your name?' He hurries on,
Old age divines with glasses on
When we lure the fellow on, 
By falling gravely ill, he's won
Some wondrous thing that she would learn.
You'll fall in love again; but learn . . .
Blind fortune's malice and men's scorn.
A quilted gown and cuckold's horn,
Two hearts, perhaps, remain forlorn
My Tanya, though, is so forlorn.
Back to our springtime's golden morn.
The villager to rise. It's morn!
While life was still but in its morn
And in the country he'd have worn
Was given us in vain, to burn;
For my poor hero, we'll adjourn
And mourn him yet. . . . But wherefore mourn?
Upon a bough above that urn;
The molten wax submerge and turn
And were deceived by it in turn;
Thus heaven wills the world to turn.
Among the pines would gently turn
And here ... at this unhappy turn
And even simple-minded fun
But once you've had your fatal fun,
A child herself, for children's fun
The name-day feast that's just begun.
This hollow world has learned to shun!
Vladimir vowed he wouldn't run
He kept consulting watch and sun . . .
Unmoved to count beneath the sun
Aurora Leads forth from morning dales the sun*
Has withered with the rising sun;
'I'll die,' she whispers to the dawn,
Cut down by fate at break of dawn!
I'll bet Onegin woke at dawn.'
Next day, for sure, they'd drive at dawn
And paler than the moon at dawn,
And trembles like a hunted fawn.
Past garden plots, small bridges, lawn,
A rumbling, black abyss did yawn. . ..
And shall I then in silence yawn
And sees the grave before it yawn,
And barely stir, all weighted down
On misty eves, she led me down
And took at last to coming down
If with your pistol you'd struck down
Buynov tried: she turned him down.
Among themselves they put her down.
As heaven's galaxy shines down
And to our rhyming guild calls down:
To wash those sizzling cutlets down;
In just her cap and quilted gown.
Tatyana, in her low-cut gown,
Absorbed his soul... as he was shown:
Base cowards, slanderers full-blown,
For loathesomeness of soula clown,
Zartskyonce a rowdy clown,
Unfaithful women he had known,
That poor enamoured girl he'd known
In whose bright company I've known
Of youthful ecstasies unknown,
And bids us cast away the crown
A bold reply, too blunt a frown,
Eye Tanya with a priggish frown,
The pines in all their beauty frown
'What can I do? Tatyana's grown,'
' Exist no more; for we've outgrown
Is what we like and call our own?
And read the books he'd called his own.
In album drawings all through town.
Pykhtin the lancer came from town
Chief gambler and arch rake in town,
The brand new ballet's on in town!
Would be the bride I'd make my own.
And you, my true ideal, my own!
Oh, Grandison! ... of course I do!'
To French. . . . There's nothing I can do!
As sweet and trusting children do.
As I from my Onegin do.
That he'd found something else to do.
Zaretsky, pleading much to do,
No matter what he tries to do;
I swear I don't know what to do;
As men today no longer do;
Have your fling, my dear ones, do! 
What aims . . . what hopes do 
Of censuring what others do?
And what a soul! . . . Come visit, do!
But what care I for all they do?
Since I dropped sinning long ago.
Called up a face from long ago.
Were you in love then, long ago?'
You loved instead to come and go
Before him faces come and go
And now she feels her kerchief go,
On soft Italian nights I'll go
What evening holds or where he'll go.
The jagged flints are set to go.
She does not bid him rise or go,
Then sadly saw the lovers go.
'Let's go.'
The cry resounds: 'Make way! Let's go!'
Feel frightened tooso let it go,
And I'm not loathe to let it go;
He's gulled the world . . . now let it go.'
Now I beg you, go!
He climbs aboard and off they go.
Deemed it a minor peccadillo;
'You know him then?' 'Well, yes and no.'
In just such albums, friends, I too
It's time that she were settled too,
Despite herself she wondered too;
This night will pass (the next one too),
My former master lived here too;
I daresay better-looking too,
And enigmatic Sbogar* too.
To trumpet, mask, and dagger* too,
And Moscow countless beauties too;
Of ancient facts and fables too
The sentimental verses too,
A story rich in feelings too,
He even read some Russians too,
In Olga's breast! What shoulders too!
To show their gall. . . and waistcoats too,
Straight out of life will crowd us too!
Each day is dear, each moment too!
I love my dear Tatyana so!
We'll not have Tanya conjure so.
From avid lips that press them so.
Some works and authors even so:
This fragile life that hurries so!
For few will understand you so,
Still love . . . because they're fated to.
Perhaps I give occasion to!
And these suggest a spa or two.
You've found at least a crumb or two.
In public speaks a word or two,
The bathhouse table laid for two.
And still consumes enough for two.
They'd shed a tender tear or two
And of a friendly glass or two
Lint-covered, in his visored cap
And more than once, in cotton cap,
(As you, of course, well know the chap);
Has opened up his window-trap.
By snowy blizzards buried deep.
We'll dig bold tunnels 'neath the deep
A lancer has enthralled her deep,
The shrubs, the land ... all lie asleep,
I read a little, often sleep,
Has lulled her wretchedness to sleep:
Will stride in broadly arching sweep;
For fleeting fame I do not weep.
Here's Petushkv, the district fop;
A goateed witch is on a mop;
Of household urchins with a whoop
And at her frightened cry a troop
Her lancer had to join his troop.
From two to thirty at the top;
One has a rooster's head on top;
Of maiden's touch and friendship's clasp.
Or chill corruption's deadly grasp,
I hear the ring of glass and cup;
The great Casino's opened up;
At dusk or entre chien et loup*
No longer cheered the family group.
Behind her back she hears the bear,
And friendly husbands hard to bear!
A cross not many choose to bear).
But speaks of him. She cannot bear
I think I must be dreaming, dear. . . .
It's Lensky . . . with Eugene! 'Oh dear!'
I find their friendship much too dear.
My springtime's golden days so dear?
As yet unseen, and yet so dear,
They held all ancient customs dear;
However much I loved you, dear,
And here's the master's study, dear;
Was younger still than me, my dear,
Not only woe.. . . It's true, my dear,
'How Tanya's grown! It seems, my dear,
'Look quickly to your left, my dear.'
He just about went mad, I fear,
Once used to you ... I'd cease, I fear;
And in her native tongue, I fear,
'He's quite forgotten us, I fear.'
I'm good for nothing now, I fear;
I shrink with shame and fear. 
Their joy is striking men with fear,
I'll take the letter, never fear.
Ah, friends, those friends! I greatly fear,
Along the merry streets you'll hear
And waits impatiently to hear.
Where skies for endless days are clear,
Your voice within my soul rang clear. . . . 
Could barely make her meaning clear;
And analyst of dreams unclear.
You know these days I'm not so clear,
Of southern winters, this is clear;
The clouds before them far and near:
And sets its sails for far and near;
And when he wished, he'd make appear
Expecting he would soon appear.
So he could quickly disappear
Tatyana, whisp'ring in her ear:
But when they learned that in the rear
The quickly summoned, glistening tear!
Or in a grave dispute he'd wear
At such an age, in such a year.
He'd almost reached his eighteenth year.
And I was just thirteen that year.
When we see him from afar, 
The tavern tribune and a liar
Or maybe merely faulty grammar
Upon the stage still romp and roar,
Onegin sits amid the roar
The peasant dance's drunken roar.
My heart and tongue once used to soar,
And hearing my sweet stanzas soar,
But then they led her to the altar
This fickel swain of every star,
Bedecked in broad-brimmed Bolivar,* 
Two soldier husbands and a war.
The falsehoods in reviews, the war,
Imported pipes of Turkish amber,
'He lives in Moscow. This December,
Oh, cousin, do you still remember
So she was called Tatyana, reader.
My most esteemed and honoured reader!
For otherwise some mocking reader
I know that you'll agree, my reader,
Or, God forbid, some wretched breeder
You futile, searching phantom-breeder,
Thus storms in autumn, blowing colder,
But when the years have made us older,
On my long work as I grow older! 
Enough! The burden's off my shoulder!
Yet I in futile dullness squander 
I search on all the paths I wander;
And leave no trace, however slender.
Of long-stemmed glasses . . . (quite as slender
To love all ages yield surrender;
Awaited here, in vain, surrender
With such a rashness in surrender,
Who taught her then this soft surrender,
Who learned to bear, without surrender,
In sad Moldavia she turned tender
And he believed that men would tender
A swarm of dreams, both sad and tender,
How keen his glance, how bold and tender;
Against a sky all blue and tender
A blessing bountiful and tender
And with a heart that's warm and tender?
This careless gift for waxing tender,
For kneeling Moscow's hand to tender
Was I like that when I was tender,
Oh, blest who in his youth was tender;
To all my youthful verses tender,
You left no prints, no pressings tender,
Of other scenes have I grown fonder:
'May I just see the house, I wonder?'
'Is she in love?''With whom, I wonder?
However, reader, we may wonder . ..
A cottage with two rowans yonder,
To find Anisya and to plunder
His dreams and songs all rent asunder;
And Petushkv as well went under.
She finds in alphabetic order
Their rings are drawn in random order;
With shouts of joy and welcome cheer.
Asked Tanya's mother, full of cheer;
With Russian pancakes, Russian cheer;
That I'd have been the first to cheer!)
That idol whom ripe misses cheer,
Sedate Bordeaux's good quiet cheer.
The answer in his solemn leer.
To join her life to his career,
Martyn Zadck,* Chaldean seer
All Europespecious wines to offer;
My soul cries out and longs to offer
The Hindu's herehis pearls to proffer,
Whenever dazzling ladies proffer
Between the meat and blancmanger,
Evoked his pity more than anger:
She never touched a fragile finger
To lift her skirt with trembling finger;
To thread a needle, wouldn't linger
She lets it lie, she mustn't linger,
And loved you with a girlish hunger;
'Onegin, I was then much younger,
And showed poor Tanya when he freed her
And some old manwhen he espied her
The men bowed lower when they spied her
All objects either scared or charmed her
All signs and portents quite alarmed her,
What casual letters he would send her!
At every turn he seems to find her,
She dare not look to see behind her,
The clink of glasses, shouts . . . confound her,
One melancholy joker found her
He's happy just to be around her,
On coming to, she looks around her:
His 'true ideal' and hovered round her
A pack of barking dogs chased round her;
To part the footmen who surround her
Came rushing quickly to surround her.
What clues the index can afford her:
The ladies flocked to stand beside her;
Once Vyzemsky* sat down beside her
And brings in merry mood before her
'It's up to me,' he thought, 'to save her.
While none held head and shoulders higher
oday, though, all we see in her
A sudden faintness comes upon her,
And thus more surely we undo her
The less we love her when we woo her,
Then this was certain sign to her
Repeats what mama taught to her.
And now another tries to trip her,
And his sly odist in The Other* 
Or games of tag upon the heather;
I roam the shore,* await fair weather,
He's ever near. In gloomy weather
The other day, in rainy weather,
'But I've so little income, father.'
'Well then, come on . . . we'll go and meet her.'
And so the prince led up to greet her
What prosy ravings strung together,
They sit in Olga's room together;
Curse masters and beat palms together;
Whenever nanny brought together
And while the horses, bored at tether,
Will freedom comeand cut my tether?
The night has countless stars to light her,
'Twas only habit then that taught her
And soon a great discovery brought her
Hussars on leave come racing hither
Here practised dandies bow and slither
About her clothes one couldn't fault her;
'Why, my dear lady, what's the bother?
'And really you prefer the other?'
In silence to destroy each other. . . .
Why, my good husband's sainted mother
And been a faithful wife and mother,
'Oh, come! Our world was quite another!
I might have found (who knows?) another
Ongin, my good friend and brother,
Recall the satirist, good brother,
Should each not part once more as brother? . . .
'Why not?''Were I the poet, brother,
Or sparkled in one way or other.
Young maidens hushed in passing by her;
A slave of God and Brigadier
Necker
Not once all day does thought but flicker,
The heart no cause to beat the quicker;
Won't kiss a lady's hand, the mocker.'
'The man's a boor, he's off his rocker.'
Can this be real? Scarce more than swaddler
And turned coquette! A fickle toddler!
Young Tanya, my enchanted dreamer;
That idle and reclusive schemer,
And sparkling in the sunlight's shimmer,
A clump of snow will fall and glimmer.
Gvozdin as well, that model farmer,
Fat Pustyakv, the local charmer,
Their natural virtue's flaunted banner;
While we, the foes of Hymen's banner,
In Lafontaine's* insipid manner.
I've marvelled at their haughty manner,
But now the shades of night grow thinner,
But he was wrong; that idle sinner
Lies snoring with his portly partner.
But give me first a pen and paper;
I won't be long . . . just leave the taper.
And purely to delight and pamper,
And from one charming foot her slipper,
Ashamed to see himself the clearer;
Upon the moon to bring it nearer;*
To make love's value all the greater
She does not say: 'Let's wait till later
Above the Neva's placid water
Then from a basin filled with water
Dame Larin's eyes began to water
I'll sprinkle you with holy water,
That made her sister's beauty sweeter
And irked by fleet success soon after,
And yet the regal moon shines brighter
Moscow! Russia's favourite daughter!
As she embraced her younger daughter
'The Lord be with you now, my daughter!'
And smothered yawns with brittle laughter:
The doors fly back; two figures enter
How often in the summer quarter,
And here's Oneginlord and master
That former wastrel and disaster;
And with their usual sort of bluster,
'Archival dandies'* in a cluster
Whose turbid streams flow down and cluster
That there exists a holy cluster
No fine parquet could hope to muster
Spring rays at last begin to muster
Thus bees from luscious hive will scatter,
Her face would pale, her teeth would chatter.
But let's abandon idle chatter
Or stand the sound of friendly chatter.
To light the sombre sky and shatter
The chairs, pushed back, give out a clatter;
Our hero's headlong, dashing clatter
And damns their idle ways and patter,
I vow, Retracting it would suit me better.
(And with good cause!), he found it better
Her maiden dreams had helped unfetter
The princess an impassioned letter.
But having read Tatyana's letter,
But that will do. My beauty's letter
Let not the poet's soul grow bitter
The stalls and pit are all ajitter;
While past its glassed-in windows flitter
Amid this world's deceptive glitter,
The theatre's full, the boxes glitter;
And on the snow make rainbows glitter.
The bearded postboy sits as spotter.
Atop a lean and shaggy trotter
Can still produce a lovely flutter
A careless drawl, a tiny stutter,
I'll never let that foul depraver
Like giddy hopeso gay and clever,
Discuss a Say or Bentham*ever;
And in the tomb his shade shall never
I wouldn't say that ladies never
Perhaps has carried off forever
And Anna Pvlovna, as ever,
But not at all: as blithe as ever,
Her husband, clubman come whatever,
She walked and walked . .. till with a shiver
Or plaintive horn would make us shiver.
It's true! The lady didn't shiver,
Behind the hill the moon's a sliver;
The grove's asleep above the river,
A garden by the glinting river.
Or floating on the drowsy river,
Or even let an eyebrow quiver,
Sings out till dawn; a crimson cover
While on the last one you'll uncover:
And I as yet could not uncover
He sometimes even dares to cover
But what did I, amazed, discover?
Upon the first page you'll discover:
In any novelyou'll discover
Was it not you who seemed to hover
But round it boredom seems to hover;
And so? Inebriated lover,
On scaring off some timid lover
Above my bed, a gentle lover,
Since young Tatyana with her lover,
And there the nightingale, spring's lover,
And deep within her rustic bower,
He sang the rose, romantic flower,
But was he happy in the flower
A valley-lily come to flower
The storm has blown; the lovely flower
When it has yet to fully flower.'
The world itself with magic power
And some few novels done with power,
The die is cast: I'm in your power, 
Can she have solved the riddle's power?
For thus our giddy race gains power:
How sad that youth, with all its power,
Calls out his name!No earthly power
Then knowthat were it in my power,
The youthful poet's friend and slayer?'
The people, yawning, in for prayer,
Would whisper it her secret prayer.
And where that gloomy, strange betrayer,
The solemn expert's learned air
Her languid and abstracted air.
Tatyana's charms and pallid air,
While picking berries, filled the air
Onegin, wasting, has the air
With carefree charm and winsome air
In silence to instruct the fair!
Or chanced upon the sad affair.
All race about on some affair.
Of some most solemn state affair;
His chance to mix in this affair
A craving for a change of air
He sees before him, wondrous fair,
She took a seat beside the chair
Each moves his setting, shifts his chair,
Came in and took the window chair.'
A greybeard too . . . with scented hair,
Her long, unloosened braids of hair,
Then runs his fingers through his hair,
That wicked gossip with his flair
The general with the prideful air.
'Why, she who with a wistful air
They needed kvas no less than air,
And in a trice they seat the pair.
The ladies to the hearth repair;
Or turn a poet in despair.
Observed by none, and near despair,
That group in front; you see that pair . . .
With pictures of a happy pair;
Onegin! 'Oh!'And light as air,
But shows a simple, quiet air.
Eugene had kept his silent air;
She's out the backway, down the stair
He's past the porter, up the stair,
The maidens whisper by the stair;
Dissolved amid the balmy air;
It's sacred to Apollo's choir;
The lover of Julie Wolmr,*
Malk-Adhl* and de Linr,*
And he recalled Tatyana's pallor,
Still sleeps on furs at carriage door;
Then Olga pushes through the door,
Then pushes straightway through the door
And glances slyly through the door.
And pushes slightly on the door. . . .
All rise; he marches to the door.
To some soire . . . and by the door,
And by the country tavern door
His world a closed and silent door?
Behind his silent study door,
Upon the ballroom's mirrored floor,
And lays her down upon the floor.
And strikes his chair against the floor;
She'd be quite overcome with terror,
To meet a black-robed monk by error,
Steps out of doors and trains a mirror
Unwillingly within the mirror,
Her weariness and helpless languor,
Atop the stove to wash and purr,
Is just another lantern's blur.
And to her doll, without demur,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,*
He died at midday's break from labour,
And you, small book, my constant labour,
Lamented much by friend and neighbour,
In toast to his attractive neighbour . . .
To glimpse the Larins' brand new neighbour;
Farewell, you too, my moody neighbour,
For my sad lot its share of splendour
Bakhchisarai,* you fount of splendour!
You came to me in nuptial splendour;
Brought up in Oriental splendour,
Their freedom for his honour's splendour;
He left the rout in all its splendour
Forgetting, then, the city's splendour,
Was love itself, the art of ardour,
All these our dreamy maiden's ardour
She hardly notes how late the hour,
Amid his conquests of the hour?
'I'm weeping. . . . Oh, at this late hour,
By dreams of him; each passing hour
For me to struggle at this hour; 
And we as well shall face that hour
Of silence at a lonely hour;
That we betrayed it every hour,
Her mournful air, her touching valour
All's quiet now. Inside the parlour,
For raising journalistic clamour,
But wearied by the ballroom's clamour,
This child of comfort and of glamour,
When men of reason and good humour
When one becomes the butt of rumour,
To be the first who thus shall honour
Relying on a tyrant's honour,
Up in that stupid sky you honour.'
'You're married! Really?''On my honour.'
Come on, let's go, do me the favour!'
With just a dash of lemon flavour.
A drink of lingonberry flavour.
With sparkling wine for us to savour.
Nor see that noxious worm devour
By ending his proud days a martyr
And Werther, that rebellious martyr,
His children at their ABCs.
And ships to us by Baltic seas
Neath flow'ring cherries and acacias,
Holds shame in savage dread, alas.
Is just the trembling moon, alas. . . .
'Then send your grandson, little Thomas,
The omission of certain stanzas has given rise on more than one occasion to criticism and jesting (no doubt most just and witty). The author candidly confesses that he has removed from his novel an entire chapter, in which Onegin's journey across Russia was described. It behoved him to indicate this omitted chapter by dots or a numeral, but to avoid ambiguity he thought it preferable to label as number eight, instead of nine, the final chapter of Eugene Onegin, and to sacrifice one of its closing stanzas:
P. A. Katenin* (whose fine poetic talent in no way prevents him from being a subtle critic as well) has observed to us that this excision, though advantageous perhaps for the reader, is none the less harmful to the work as a whole, for it makes the transition from Tatyana the provincial miss to Tatyana the exalted lady too sudden and unexplained: an observation that reveals the accomplished artist. The author himself felt the justness of this reproach but decided to omit the chapter for reasons important to him, but not to the public. Some few excerpts have been published already; we insert them here, along with several other stanzas.
Then puts his couplet in her hands.
Beneath the lines from other hands,
From Goethe's and from Schiller's hands.
Of woods and mills and streams and lands;
Beneath the skies of distant lands,
A country squire, there he stands,
Is first to toast her where he stands,
He plants a tender verse that stands
The shutters open, smoke ascends
Share meals and pastimes, thoughts and ends?
And their dull means to festive ends.
I liked his ways and we made friends.
Dearest hearts and darling friends, 
And so estranged these former friends?
Unmindful too of town or friends
In pale blue shafts from chimney ends.
With vain pursuit of worldly ends;
Good Petushkv, to Olga bounds;
Each morning through the park and grounds.
Or arm in arm they make their rounds
Muzhiks and merchants, Cossack guards;
Past towers, hovels, boulevards,
Regards those streams and smoky clouds,
Onegin, mid those mournful crowds,
My goddesses! You vanished faces!
'He's here! But all those faces!
One foot upon the ground she places,
And land of harsh, forbidding places;
Time was, when flunkies in high places
Have other maidens gained your places,
Who rests within the heart's sweet places
Those kin who've come from distant places
At home the poet, seething, paces
Amid the drifting, snowbound spaces
Your mount, if put to try his paces
Go ride the steppe's harsh open spaces?
To sigh for sombre Russia's spaces,
He could, it's true, from twenty paces,
With dawn's first rays Tatyana races
And gazing softly, she embraces
I write .. . and want no more embraces;
The girl's attentive eye embraces
Their daughters, after brief embraces,
Are always met with warm embraces,
As does a drunk in sleep's embraces,
' But still her anguished heart embraces
Like down from Eol's lips she races;
The covenants of bygone races,
In silence Moscow's youthful graces
Then in his babbling neighbour races,
Some pages still preserved the traces
A dark and seething torrent races,
My straying pen no longer traces,
To bring Lepage's deadly pieces;*
The guardsman clinks his spurs and dances,
She too now yawns and, as she dances,
How oft have tearful poets chances
To read their works before the glances
Seeks Lensky out with furtive glances;
A hot pursuit of flaming glances;
Nor wanton sighs, nor tender glances
You stirred me with your wondrous glances,
It hints to probing, ardent glances
From early youth she read romances,
That child of ventures and finances,
Like Byron's Harold, lost in trances,
Of rich rewards and peerless trances;
You filled my dreams and sweetest trances; 
The merchant to the port advances,
The very windows shook like Hades.
Above their brows the sign of Hades:
You libraries of darkest Hades
The drawing room had rich brocades
And stoves of tile in many shades.
One dreams of ruling multitudes;
One craves the scent that war exudes;
But Moscow never bent her knees,
By tyrant-fashion's high decrees,
The hunter hiding in the trees.
In trade for tallow and for trees;
The mix of years and ranks she sees.
Breeds ducks and geese, and oversees
When suddenly far off it sees
With children of all shapes and ages
A call to ring throughout the ages.
When he drives home, she still engages
From eighteen-eight with tattered pages;
I must have known a thousand pages
He fills her album's fleeting pages
And in the novel's final pages,
Nor read its novel's final pages;
With notes that run to seven pages,
But sometimes there are certain pages
.' Just solemn odes? .. . On all our pages?!
I'd swear it's from some novel's pages!'
Nor Seneca's, nor Byron's pages,
Chamfort, Manzoni, Herder's pages;
They hang pretentious menu pages,
Shall I grow bored with mirth and rages,
And in her gaudy mantle rages
'The way they did in former ages,
(Outlandish things, mere foolish rages,
Who wouldn't grow fatigued with rages,
Beneath two pine trees, old for ages.
When passion's flame no longer rages,
And nursing noble passion's rages,
Once more he turned to books and sages.
She read, my friends, that king of sages
When we at last turn into sages
The two Skotinins, grey as sages,
'And here's my Tanya.' 'Lord, it's ages!
'Well, what about it? Lord, it's ages. . .
On unknown faces on the stages?
No inns exist. At posting stages
But where Melpomene still stages
Perhaps, upon the world's great stages,
And found in one a list of wages,
Above our waters iron bridges
And even part whole mountain ridges;
The social ritual never changes:
The hostess artfully arranges
Upon the square the crowd emerges,
Begins to fade. The vale emerges
The marker, half asleep, emerges
And then, mid trees, a hut emerges;
Have all become mere comic urges,
The shepherd's pipe resounds and urges
Once more that touch ignites and urges
I take a stroll. Inciting urges,
Along a forest road he surges,
The wayward fits, the final surges,
Once more imagination surges,
The great finale's thunder surges.
But blest is he who rightly gauges
But as the rural dusk encroaches,
He waits.... At last his guest approaches:
(And you, good reader, with your hunches,
The frost already cracks and crunches;
That any garret babbler hatches,
And all the social rabble snatches;
She flies and breaks through lilac bushes,
And halt the constant surge of blushes;
When earth's horizon softly blushes,
To glance behind her; on she pushes
But still her heart in panic rushes,
And wind, the morning's herald, rushes,
She loved the fictions and the fancies
But now it's changed: we're all like ladies;
For love offends these charming ladies.
But you, odd tomes of haughty ladies,
Your fateful tempter's figure lies.
Stared out the window, and squashed flies.
To shatter slander's cup of lies;
To arm my gaze and speech with lies:
Corrupt her youthful heart with lies,
Where swans call out and beauty dallies,
Imploring aspect, mute replies
To answer her. His mind supplies
Bokhrins, sleighs, apothecaries,
A-seethe with plenty's wares and cries.
Her ears resound with ringing cries,
Upon her fevered tongue and dries.
Great balconies and monasteries;
And she was not the sort who glories
How oft, mid far Caucasia's glories,
Would light the way with secret stories!
In girlish pranks; but grisly stories
Cherries, yes, and raspberries, 
The merchant's up, the pedlar scurries,
A waddling red-foot goose now scurries
With jug in hand the milkmaid hurries,
And down he goes! The first snow flurries
And ill at ease, he scarcely tries
You rustic Priams from the cities,
And you, my sentimental pretties
Of course the love of tender beauties
This generation's younger beauties,
And verses will be common duties.
Your claim upon its joyous duties
Of oligarchic colloquies,
Curl out of sight; the hearth exhales
Takes on a film of ash and pales;
It's now the British Muse's fables
That lie on maidens' bedside tables
To fevered rhyme: for thus he doubles
Subduing passion's host of troubles,
And some of Venus, some of Piles.
Coquettes would leave their ageing smiles
before his eyes Makriev Market* stirs and bustles,
Distorted sweetly all the rules
And fondly watched her girlhood games;
When we play our maiden games!'
The torment of a heart in flames,
But now! . . . What unbecoming schemes
You're now subdued, you vaulting schemes
To waste itself in empty schemes.
Have drawn from love abundant themes;
Within a book her heart's extremes,
And arguments, and happy times!
That splendid view of distant domes,
Of churches, belfries, stately homes!
And, oh, how many jests and rhymes,
But one long string of dreary scenes
No sapient truths, no pretty scenes
Yet neither Virgil's, nor Racine's,
'Lovely maidens, pretty ones, 
Good friends no less than ardent foes
Alone upon his way he goes
Sleep shuns her bed, all sweetness goes,
The time goes by and, as it goes,
But even friendships like our heroes
Poor Tanya burns in joyless throes;
And does not heed my present woes.
Unlike those merchants filled with cares,
Of those they love? Good sense declares
That no reward on earth compares.
Runs to the stricken youth . . . and stares!
Some jars of jam and kitchen wares,
From Istanbul, the seaside's wares.
Grande Dame of lofty social spheres?
And where are you, poetic fires,
Its token beauty stokes the fires,
The first within me light no fires,
Across the river, smoky fires
And where are stormy love's desires,
The wilful swarm of hot desires.
I've learned the voice of new desires
His double glass he calmly centres
For pain and grief as well as pleasures,
I give myself to harmless pleasures
Were my Onegin's saintly pleasures,
I thank you for your host of treasures,
Fair summer's days and careless treasures,
And far niente rules my leisures:
We all take on Napoleon's features,
My soul preserved their secret features;
The Muse then made them living creatures:
And millions of our fellow creatures
The sleigh's prepared; his pacing ceases;
Then for a moment chatter ceases
The droning music never ceases;
And steps inside. The crush increases,
The clink of plates and forks increases,
Our stock of dead ideas and phrases?
'For whom these sighs your lyre raises?
You're right. And will you point with praises
And sang the Salghir captives' praises.*
But hush! A strident critic rises
His eyes aflame, Onegin rises
The sudden gust of wind surprises
Of elegy in all its guises
Steel files and combs in many guises,
Oh, why have I no bullet's bruises?
And sparkling Southern sun dispenses
Where all breathes Europe to the senses,
Those journals where each modern Moses
La morale est dans la nature des choses*
Like flighty Venus when she chooses
In bonnets and malignant poses;
But where such madrigals and roses
She heeds and doesn't heed the roses,
The aged ladies, decked in roses,
Indifferent to admirers' roses;
Through ranks of men from highborn classes,
'Well, I despise your upper classes
Up chimney flue. The sparkling glasses
No modish connoisseur his glasses,
By sentry booths and peasant lasses;
And far aheadCaucasian masses.
Across these once imperilled passes.
The sleigh glides over ruts and passes
A breath of warmth. The pipe smoke passes
(As was the casefor nothing passes
'Well, where's the harm ... the evening passes.'
And lo! my beauty calmly passes
Both others' and their own successes,
They passed the garden's dark recesses,
The beauties in their filmy dresses,
The ways in which a state progresses
All innocence, their talk progresses .
Where commerce, bustling, crowds and presses
The swarming gallery throng that presses,
For country freedom too possesses
When basic products it possesses.
A stream that bubbles, foams, and hisses.
At times the fresh and youthful kisses
The soul with endless youthful kisses,
Where girlfriends scribble hopes and blisses
Long rambles, reading, slumber's blisses,
I'm sure you've known provincial misses;
Eugene, who'd fled their wild abuses,
More often, though, my two recluses
And with a wistful sigh he muses:
Before the fronts of darkened houses,
What? Invitations? Yes, three houses
My services to save your houses:
And so I offer, worthy spouses,
At least three hours he peruses
Some mornings still abed he drowses,
Along a street that gently drowses,
And cuts the ice with ringing skates;
The joyous tribe of boys berates
And slurp from salty shells those bites
And all that quickens and excites,
Of plump and living anchorites,
Qu 'crirez-vous sur ces tablettes? 
In quick succession silhouettes
The hearts of even skilled coquettes!
To fall about her feet like slaves!
O how I envied then the waves
And on her covered table serves
On little dishes her preserves,
His stricken, sick, extinguished eyes,
On breast and falls. His misted eyes
And softly dim her gentle eyes.
The jesting praise, the pleading eyes .. .
to look at you with cheerful eyes
And sparkles dance before her eyes.
As tears well up to dim her eyes.
She can't go on, she shuts her eyes;
While everywhere before your eyes
Where every day before his eyes
Poor Lensky can't believe his eyes.
How sensuous her wondrous gazes! . . .
With what celestial pride she grazes
Straight scissors, curved ones, thirty sizes
While in the back her husband dozes,
Where sweet Thalia calmly dozes,
But Olga didn't read the things.
The charm of gravely simple things,
Has overpraised these haughty things:
The age of hopes and tender yearnings,
But when the age of restless turnings
At Trinity, when service brings
They're hardly worth the songs one sings
I'll show the children's secret meetings
I'll give a father's simple greetings,
And youthful hopes on youthful wings.
Of choral dances, garden swings.
Vladimir's stormy soul grew wings;
When we sing our secret songs,
Clandestine rides in dashing sleighs;
Kibitkas, britzkas, coaches, sleighs.
Shall I return?' And Tanya sighs,
The cavatina, heated sighs,
With fiery praise . . . and heated sighs;
She takes a garden path and sighs,
By turns Tatyana groans and sighs.
For forty years had heaved his sighs,
How changed Tatyana is!
She'll share with none, aloud like this.
Of shaded, idle times like this,
You stayed his friends despite all this:
Thus heaven's gift to us is this:
How often on the shores of Tauris,*
O lovely land, you shores of Tauris,
The two found everything a basis
Or why not crippled with arthritis,
A twinge at least of some bursitis?
With mighty Russian hammer whacks,
The Kra's and Argva's banks*
The frost has gleamed, and we give thanks
Have seen the Russians' tented ranks.
For Mother Winter's happy pranks.
A murmur through the ballroom steals . . .
And thus they aged, as do all mortals.
That death had opened wide its portals,
And claps salute him. Tanya feels
A stately general at her heels.
That shaggy footman at her heels! . . .
And ever faster on she reels;
Constrained to curtsey . . . almost reels.
Bacchante-like, at all our revels,
Red bloody tongues and snouts and nails,
And mind the beauty of his nails.
And whiskers, tusks, and tufted tails,
For custom's rule o'er man prevails.
The young pursued my Muse like devils;
I even now would worship balls.
In liveried ranks where'er she calls,
In following where pleasure calls!
Incessantly the serpent calls
She falls ....
Or fetch her kerchief when it falls.
What's given to us ever palls,
Are nothing more to us than tools . . . Since feelings are for freaks and fools.
And have they not, the charming fools,
And now she leaps! And now she whirls!
And then the other slowly twirls,
While through the glass his mother scowls.
And laughs out loud between his howls,
Though now and then some gossip gleams.
You pitied then my girlish dreams. . . .
Their hopes, and pranks, and maiden dreams;
Her secret passions, and her dreams.
But other days bring other dreams;
When cherished beings filled my dreams.
For your sake smothered all my dreams
These stupid woods and fields and streams!
Oh, by the way, Dame Larin seems
His cold, embittered mind that seems
While Iso long ago it seems!
By Olga's winning, youthful charms,
To serve sweet bondage with his arms.
Perceive full well that home life means
Their fathers, who were friends, had plans
With far too many foreign loans;
It's Lensky's troika, three fine roans;
'Come on, let's dine, my stomach groans!'
That as it is my diction groans
The servants fussed and raised the dickens
The featherbeds and coops of chickens,
But where he now no longer reigns . . .
And tears asunder winter's chains;
Where only his sad trace remains.
Against the will, inside their brains
While I roar out the light refrains.
A hoary frothing wave that strains
'Farewell, my peaceful vales and fountains!
Farewell, you too, familiar mountains
To read one day their marriage banns.
Nor scorned the social mob's decisions;
Who never knew exotic visions,
And though we're loath to cast aspersions,
Our northern summers, though, are versions
Eugene devised a few concessions
Alone amid his new possessions,
A tempting riddle of confusions;
He entertained with fond illusions
On 'kinfolk' and their implications?
To rowdy feasts and altercations
Or cunningly start altercations;
Have filled the house; whole congregations
He fled their noisy congregations
The corset, albums, chic relations,
Well, here's my view of close relations:
Since dawn Dame Larin's near relations
And love's sweet crown of jubilations.
But Hymen's cares and tribulations,
Now greetings come, congratulations;
She gave the poet intimations
There Ozerov received the nation's
And in the wings . . . the assignations?
Retreats for happy assignations;
And what of other fascinations?
To speak in singsong intonations,
In days of dreams and dissipations
No surer place for declarations,
And how's the plague? What conflagrations,
That all our finest aspirations,
Our brightest dreams and inspirations,
Of sleepless nights, light inspirations,
You're sure to find there decorations:
I sing strange whims and aberrations, 
Your endless croakings and gyrations
And found their solemn conversations
And quite devoid of affectations;
To all her foreign affectations,
But when Eugene's felicitations
And, filling all his meditations,
'Have done with all your lamentations,
She used to write, with blood, quotations
And drink the draught of love's temptations,
No lasting truths or dissertations
Which just-delivered importations
You'll read, no doubt, fond protestations:
The bane of midnight sentry stations;
He loved good merry disputations,
Unbidden tears and its ovations,
The intellect's cold observations,
On which, herewith, these observations:
How dull to hear the same objections,
You may have sought in these reflections
To overcome those predilections
Tumultuous, fond recollections,
For naturefond of contradictions
Yet even in these same afflictions
A due respect for his afflictions
'My uncle, man of firm convictions* . . .
The heart's dark secrets and traditions,
Vague threats and rumours, premonitions;
Can be excused his rash intentions.
No plaything of the mob's conventions
Eugene, of course, had keen perceptions
And since each rule permits exceptions,
That Paris of the local towns,
All sentiments and deem men zeros
Guffawing, barking, whistles, claps,
And human speech and hoofbeat taps!
A maiden's looking-glass she keeps.
Now all is hushed. Tatyana sleeps.
With native glibness from their lips?
While yet a foreign language slips
Past urchins, streetlamps, strolling fops,
Past diplomats and soldier-fops,
By gardens, mansions, fashion shops;
And silently his pistol drops.
Has struck at last: the poet stops
And haughty dames . . . then calmly stops
To murmur lies in aged ears.
'And since I pulled you by the ears!'
Entreaties, vows, pretended fears,
No matter: childish hope appears
As through a mist of stifled tears. . . .
Betrayals, gossip, rings, and tears,
All girlish fainting-fits and tears,
To all these letters and these tears.
She softly sheds a flood of tears.
The heart's reflections, writ in tears.
Yet once he'd moved her heart to tears!
And since I dried your baby tears!'
Born of my green and withered years . . .
Oh then at least, my tender years
He'd borne enough in former years.
Companion of so many years,
The restless gallery claps and roars;
The curtain rustles as it soars.
Beneath the gleam of lamps and stars.
Still longer half the globe encumbers,
The grunting, loathesome bear still lumbers,
And late the lazy East still slumbers
Before them now a forest slumbers;
Two special feet. And in my slumbers
That all of Russia scarcely numbers
But now the hammer's smashing boulders,
The salvaged streets will muster shoulders,
From bed to icy bath he wanders,
This homage that the great world tenders,
Childe Harold-like, Onegin ponders,
Would hear the bailiff, give his orders,
To greet an entrechat with cheers,
Or Cleopatra with his jeers,
And cheek in hand as down she peers,
To those with lavish whims and coffers,
Whatever clever London offers
'Oh, nanny, life's so full of dangers,
'And so they took me off to strangers ...
Does not withdraw impassive fingers
The letter trembles in her fingers;
Begins to trace with lovely fingers
Her gaze upon his face still lingers;
The rosy sealing wafer lingers
Tatyana by the window lingers
To touch a torrid hand to hers,
But I prefer above these others
By making his the thoughts of others
Once more an idler, now he smothers
The joy and hope of district mothers
Made meetings dull at one another's;
But those to whom, as friends and brothers,
Diana's breast is charming, brothers,
But God, what deadly boredom, brothers,
And in the end were close as brothers.
And now from nearby quarters, brothers,
May his example profit others;
'Some are no more, and distant. . . others.'*
She kept the books, she shaved the shirkers,*
She'd drive around to check the workers,
The sleighs, and rosy snow that shimmers
Crisp days when sunlit hoarfrost glimmers,
The time of day by teas and dinners,
By supper's call. We country sinners
Mashk, the source of healing waters;
Old Aunt Elena never falters
In them, though, nothing ever alters;
As all applaud, Onegin enters
Amid its magic brooks and quarters
He slept, took coffee in these quarters,
But we, we band of callow joysters,
Have been expecting only oysters . . .
And damns his folly in these matters
But he departs, his hopes in tatters,
Gone numb with terror, Tanya shivers . . .
And snorts in fear, the traveller shivers
Just so a hare in winter shivers,
Catching the scent, the road horse quivers
Just so a butterfly both quivers
Reverberates ... the cabin quivers;
And now his gazing eye discovers
Through silent woods and so discovers
Draws back the curtains and his covers,
And hasn't stirred; still slumber hovers
Sharp-peaked and ringed by hills, it hovers . . .
She wanders with her borrowed lovers
For that small churchyard's shaded bowers,
But one glance back. Farewell, you bowers,
The country, love, green fields and flowers,
Of our old home, its walks and flowers,
But I my fancy's fruits and flowers
Two maidens used to come with flowers,
Grey clouds against a sky that lowers,
Great heaps of straw from threshing mowers,
She learned to use her woman's powers
The mattresses, the trunks and chairs,
And arm in arm, they seek their chairs:
Eugene, in sudden chill, despairs,
But dinner's served. And so by pairs,
A beetle hummed. The peasant choirs
negin opened cupboard doors
You fortunate procrastinators,
Now is the time, you hibernators,
To help her with her shawl or furs,
Her flowers, novels, daily labours ...
The countryside, poor village neighbours,
'To me, Onegin, all these splendours,
Betwixt her chores and idle hours
Impassioned days and idle hours,
With what delight I praise those hours
And sometimes in the evening hours
Am quite content to read for hours
But enmity among their class
Or Veuve Cliquot, the finest class,
'Alright, I'll go.' 'Well done, first class!'
All lost in thought, the gentle lass
A disenchanted opera glass,
His figure in the looking-glass;
But all that shows in her dark glass
And with these words he drained his glass
And set beside the poet's glass.
And breathes upon the chilly glass;
And where's her sister now, poor lass?
The gowns, the talk, the milling mass,
And when across this world I pass
Then through his dressing room he'll pass
Or did the time of tears soon pass?
The slow parade of guests who pass
Napoleon, drunk with fresh success,
And Ialas, I must confess
A distance luminous and boundless. . . .
All thoughts of time returninggroundless;
Her hero . . . who was none the less
I'll never know. But none the less,
Awakened early none the less,
And man of honour, nothing less:
Pursue her now a good deal less.
And what we called a fop, no less.
And on the road . . . grown lean and fearless,
The dawn arises cold and cheerless;
For I have known too well the witless
The crush, the glitter, and the gladness,
Or am I now inured to gladness;
His parents' dust. . . their memory's gladness . . .
The holy days are here. What gladness! .. .
I love youth's wanton, fevered madness,
But flaming youth in all its madness
And then with verse of quickened sadness
Casts only spleen and languid sadness
Its loves and hates, its joy and sadness,
Bright youth divines, not knowing sadness,
Aroused in you some hint of kindness;
Have brought you to my feet? What blindness!
And how he'd seize a moment's weakness
To conquer youthful virtue's meekness
Politely, but with cold directness,
The note was brief in its correctness,
Why no one, friends, as God's my witness,
Rewards you with a soft caress?
One loosened curl with soft caress
As sweet as love's own soft caress;
That in their burning flow caress
And then he'd dress. . . .
Do you now clothe in sacred dress?'
By candlelight she'd rise and dress.
I give it here in feeble dress:
Amid its park. In sombre dress
Thus does our age its sins redress!
No Grandison in Russian dress.
Or kiss the border of her dress.
Was quite the pedant in his dress
As gay as morning's rosy dress,
Coursed on and never ceased to press
In pallid swarms the patients press,
Your haughty glance may well express!
I know you'll feel a deep distress 
All victims: someof war's distress,
Alas, it isn't hard to guess!
You learn life's sweetness . . . feel its kiss,
No rosy cheek that I might kiss,
But you, you men in wedded bliss,
Her cherished trove of tears and bliss
And summon forth a sombre bliss,
That habit takes the place of bliss.
No maiden's lips were equal bliss,
I spent my days of deepest bliss?
Tatyana murmured, at a loss;
And left her husband at a loss.
To lend a hand to help her cross.
She beat the maids when she was cross
Can tell the time without great fuss:
Where no one raised the slightest fuss:
No cards, no balls, no poets' feats
All bustle round and lie like cheats,
To tender novels she retreats,
For private and for other debts;
Treats Europe's dainty artefacts
And commerce reigns in all the streets
With no great palaces, no streets,
The fools one never once forgets;
There is no path; the gorge that plummets,
To crush a rivaloh, what nets,
Of ladies and their modish pets.
The nobly born and fashion's pets;
Who gained in turn, without regrets,
She rode with me those craggy heights!
That sparkles, triumphs, and delights
Her share of travel's dull delights:
Regretted still his past delights
Are Tasso's octaves' soaring flights.
Would muse on passions* and their flights.
They rode for seven days and nights.
But sweeter still, amid such nights,
Like fair Lenore,* on moonlit nights
His eyes retain their stare; but she Sits
Takes in their ravishing deceits!
By clumps of snow; and through the summits
Where just Terpsichore enchants
Shall once again I hear your chants?
And while the weary band of servants
While all those cupids, devils, serpents
Ludmila's and Rusln's adherents!*
And visited the humble tents
Its noisy feasts and grand events,
(On meeting her at some dull aunt's)
The host of girls on marriage hunts
Rosettes, a torch, a pair of hearts;
With meaning for our Russian hearts!
The thing he'd learned above all arts,
In noisy haste the throng departs;
How many echoes it imparts!
The sum of all our hero's parts,
With all my love, till death us parts; 
Approaches Olga . . . idly jests,
Then spins her round before the guests;
And over wine she sang for guests;
#62038; Rus'!*
The old Derzhvin* sawand blessed us,
And with a smile the world caressed us;
But from our friends, dear God, defend us!
But we must grant, though it offend us:
(But aren't they one, if they offend us?)
Enlightenment has failed to mend us,
As first I saw you rise before us,
Just so! The tomb that lies before us
Arriving home together thus
Plants cabbages like old Horatius,
Never come to spy on us
He died too soon ... his death courageous,
#62038; rus!
The stomach serves as clock for us;
Falls silent fast. Alone the chorus
The Nereids'* eternal chorus
Who'll coddle us and never doubt us?
Who won't sow slander all about us?
And crosses dense with flocks of daws.
Past gateway lions' lifted paws,
In arid gossip, questions, news
Or tell them all the city news.
To bring two centuries to blows.
A stream of elegies then flows.
And filled with truth's own vivid glows
Pour forth their warm and cheerful glows
And quickly blamed him, heaven knows!
That high and mighty Moscow knows.
Our mighty tongue, God only knows,
The bill to awesome stature grows.
The double carriage lamps in rows
A bold kibitka skips and burrows
And ploughs a trail of fluffy furrows;
Are out of fashion nowadays.
By Lensky's brief, ill-fated days.
To decent folk for days and days,
How oft in childhood days
Through all her years since cradle days,
Let's grant to fevered youthful days
It charmed me too, in other days:
The very springtime of his days,
Nor hear the ages bless his days.
Of wildest youth's most fervent days
Had stirred his soul since early days.
But no! Each moment of my days
Brief passages from Nordic lays;
How surely She's taken up the role she plays!
I know that gentle Parny's* lays
Of neighbour clans have come in drays,
When he, in flaming verse, portrays
And then at home all day he stays,
Repeating it a hundred ways
Your noble thoughts and simple ways.
Her lordly rank's commanding ways!
Were just as dull as city highways;
Adrift in idle, slothful ways;
She blossomed in a maiden's ways
A perfect love of righteous ways,
With rules, traditions, ancient ways
And then he saw that country byways
(A simile in many ways);
The ancient Kremlin's hallowed keys.
Those springtime days in secret valleys,
For just my books, the simple joys
It still retains its pristine joys:
For all your gifts and all your joys;
With bark of pugs and maidens' joys,
I leave your world of quiet joys
Their laughing shouts and giddy joys.
Three bottles daily from Vry's.*
Is half a crane and half a cat.
Some distant droshky's rumbling beat;
Its hatreds, hopes, and loves still beat,
Then spins and twists and stops to beat
And listen for the heart's first beat,
And there the crush, the glare, the heat,
Its blood ran hot with life's own heat.
Recall the words of passion's heat,
It's time for flowers, labours, heat,
Wet nurses shout and babies bleat.
And gave the neighbours quite a treat.
Old-fashioned Russian welcome treat.
Then stalk love fasterand entreat
Oh, all that I might then entreat!. ..
Enchanting creatures that entreat
And treads on toes to reach his seat;
Spring calls you to your country seat;
At Madame Larin's country seat
ith clouded brow beneath a hat,
While spinning round in bright red hat;
Beside a short-tailed dwarf. . . and that
Proceeds to talk of this and that;
And life went smoothly after that.
'Should I go on, turn back, or what?
The arms compressed and folded flat.
In ancient hall or modern flat.
In glasses and a torn old coat,
I'll corner him and catch his coat
To rule the house as autocrat,
He yawned alike where'er he sat,
Two minutes barely has she sat. . .
A crab upon a spider sat;
The time will come without a doubt
A gambler and a guards cadet.
The shapes of ladies' heads and feet.
Those words with whichbefore the feet
On stilts alone can feeble feet
The whirling flash of pairs of feet,
Her rapid, dazzling, dancing feet.
The guests all bow and scrape their feet,
The charming ladies twirl their feet
Are quite as faithless as their feet.
Your knees . . . and, sobbing at your feet,
Petrvsky Castle. Hey! Be fleet!
On ladies he has yet to meet.
And on arrival duly meet
And now along Tverskya Street
Or suddenly from Million Street
Attempt to ford the muddy street.
I'd sip my Turkish coffee sweet.
Their charming words and glances sweet
And then postponed till they could get
How long it took me to forget
But I can't blame you or forget
In our day too, let's not forget),
And to the opera we must get,
For this delicious epithet;
Some moments passed in utter quiet,
With slippers and a dressing jacket,
He rings in haste and, with a racket,
The grove, the hill, the field, the thicket
She's levelled with a fluffy blanket
The prima donna? The ballet?
The pranks and fun when first they'd met.
The same old patterns still are met:
I'll cease one day to be a poet
But you're not even listening, pet.'
Proud Orpheus and Europe's pet.
This Grandison was fashion's pet,
Your cheeks are poppies now, my pet.'
That lady in the red beret?'
No trace at all of last night's fret,
Tormented now by deep regret,
With nothing that it must regret,
And come to know a new regret;
His clothing for the learned set.
That wedding plans had long been set,
I'm sick at heart and all upset,
With evening's gloom, the day has set. . .
Tatyana's scarce alive; Triquet,
And brought along Monsieur Triquet,
Three pairs of shapely feet. .. And yet,
'Can that be she? ... It seems . . . and yet. . .
Stand fizzing on the table yet;
And sees the truth: she loves him yet! 
But though it's won no favour yet, '
And I lament old sorrows yet.
And wears that same tulle bonnet yet;
With all of life before it yet
Onegin, noting Lensky'd left,
Which made poor Olga feel bereft.
While high above the moon's aloft,
The breathless night is warm and soft,
From porch to yard, to garden straight;
He might have scaled a lofty height.
Could get two friends prepared to fight,
Her prim conceited face alight,
Or shall my mournful gaze alight
One splendid house is all alight,
And then he soared, his soul alight
And wakes to find her room alight,
When midnight sky is limpid-light
He sleeps in blissful, sheer delight
There'll be a ball! What sheer delight!
Or manufactures for delight,
They'll welcome us with great delight.'
To whisper hope and sweet delight?
With sinless dreams of sweet delight.
Like convicts sent in dreaming flight
Perform her soaring, soulful flight?
While Morpheus still roamed in flight;
Still stir my heart at times to flight:
And slowly day begins its flight.
And by the matchwood's crackling light
But now the moonbeams' glowing light
And with the moon's celestial light
I'd grieve to quit this world's dim light
Vivacious, brilliant. . . and too light.
On any theme but our own plight.
And wakes her nurse to share her plight.
And said a prayer to soothe my plight?
Assails her heart, he brings her light,
The hostess kept the banter light
Beneath the moonbeams' silver light
In dancing too his step was light,
Like Cypris* bathed in morning's light.
Could not eclipse her neighbour's light.
In sunset's glow, the murky light
And as he bid the girl goodnight,
That wraps about the Yuletide night.
The balmy fragrance of the night!
Amid the stillness of the night,
And sleeps beside her through the night.
Tatyana tosses through the night
Her lovely shoulder to the night.
The hours of waking and of night
In winter, when the shade of night
Just killing time that way each night?'
His martyred shade, condemned to night,
Who turns each morning into night.
'The colonel's sending it tonight.'
'I'm not.''Well then, why not tonight?
So marmot-like through winter's night
As in a misty dream at night,
Don't lower your lorgnettes at night!
Just so a casual guest at night
Flit softly through this lucent night?
First off, he'd been at fault last night
Sweet thoughts of him in darkest night,
And climbed a gentle hill by night.
With stillness, stars, the lonely night,
She spins away the wintry night.
The conversation sparkled bright;
Ivn Petrvich ... no more bright;
The river gay and sparkling bright,
The frozen windows sparkling bright,
In wavy carpets glistening bright;
Its countless lampions burning bright;
With golden crosses, ember-bright.
With conscience as his judge of right,
Or arrow passes byall's right:
But you, Bordeaux, I find just right;
'Why not at all.''Well, serves you right;
However dazzling to the sight
While Lensky rages at the sight.
Devises to attract the sight,
Of dinners stretching out of sight,
The princess sits alone in sight,
To keep your daughters well in sight;
From shipboard looming into sight,
First floated dimly into sight
Beheld outdoors a wondrous sight:
Or press her lips together tight.
Semyn Petrvich . . . just as tight;
The hearth, the double panes shut tight
His heart, so full of pain, drew tight;
And sit for hours seeing naught,
Who takes cold intellect for naught,
And finally left it when they bought
Or so at least with joy he thought.
Of youthful feeling, youthful thought,
From here he watched, immersed in thought,
And drove back home, immersed in thought;
Above the chessboard deep in thought,
He racked his brains and rather thought
For argument or food for thought:
The fruits that learned science brought,
To learn the news: has heaven brought
A roving pedlar one day brought
That miracles could still be wrought.
The awesome blaze my Moscow wrought.
Exalted, tender, boldly wrought?
The long-awaited sail he sought?
Disturbed the slumber that he sought.
Upon a deuce, that cunning bait.
And weeping, they undid my plait,
My fair Tatyana's noblest trait. . .
Beloved friend, sweet friend, I wait,
The duellists shed their cloaks and wait.
And nature seemed to wait and wait
The empty fields in silence wait;
Been foolish when I failed to wait;
She runs, she flies; she dare not wait
And no one's ears were shocked a bit
To spread their grudging shade a bit.
And all worn out, she wept a bit,
My dear Elvina, I adore it
In winter with the hearth before it,
Then broke into a coughing fit.
Shoot pistol at an ace and hit;
But by the third he couldn't stick it:
Both river and the shores that flank it.
And how the ladies' eyes he lit
The spleen is what the English call it,
We still, alas, cannot forestall it
With throbbing head about to split:
Has forced young boughs, I must admit,
But if you knew the anguish in it:
Would praise him for his nasty grit:
From where the smug and worthless sit?
For rhyme, saw fit to resurrect it
We've got to have forbidden fruit,
Amusement's yield, the careless fruit
Sends forth rich blooms and gives sweet fruit.
Of sundry chapters as my suit:
Or go on dropping words of wit
With flashes of his sudden wit!
But what's the point? I'd like to know it.
Because the dull are cramped by wit?
By all the flow of lively wit.
'You wrote to me. Do not deny it.
The fate that Tula clerk was dealt?
And why #62038; Lordhave I not felt
You gorgeous albums stamped with gilt,
And racks where modish rhymesters wilt,
To do what helpless horses can't.
Their talk's absurd, if harmless, cant.
Poised to the magic bow attendant,
Just what the dreadful vision meant.
For whom, Tatyana, is it meant?
But thrifty neighbours waxed indignant
Still others sneered or turned malignant,
And then the bent-head oxen pant
But generally, you'll have to grant,
His life flowed onquite calm and pleasant
I've known great beauties proudly distant,
Implacable, to all resistant,
And yet he's stubborn . . . still resistant,
In that brief instant then, who couldn't
And in the princess then, who wouldn't
Why I've seen ladies so complacent
My student cell turned incandescent;
And sang of childhood effervescent,
And glidesso peaceful and transcendent. . . .
This distant goddess so transcendent,
And there . .. ethereal. .. resplendent,
But this cool princess so resplendent,
A frosty night, the sky resplendent
That they would even grow impatient
Oh, happy he who's known the ferment
And sighed, recalling their interment.
And was it not in past enjoyment
Or seek some other sweet employment:
Sweet wilderness in which I spent
My fleeting, youthful days were spent.
But where are all your evenings spent?'
Then stretched a paw . . . sharp claws abhorrent,
And worked her way across the torrent
With kindly neighbours sometimes present
What secret message she'd been sent,
Is Saturday. Her mother's sent
The letter's readyall but sent. . .
'What's wrong?' She peered at him, intent.
And filled my soul with dreams, content.
There too, beneath the theatre's tent,
Still hopeful and indeed persistent.
And what ensued from that event;
'Goodbye, Onegin . . . time I went.'
'It's nothing.' And away he went.
To tell you how this meeting went
Now don't refuse, it's time you went.'
That bachelors' lives were out of joint;
Would touch obliquely on the point
He'd swim across this Hellespont;
Then afterwards, as was his wont,
The world for just a time forgot,
The monde, the noisy ball forgot;
Of ancient customs unforgot.
A brace of pistols and a shot
The evening samovar grew hot;
A little learning means a lot.
Some general stared her way a lot.
Behind a nearby stump Guillot
'Why here he is: Monsieur Guillot,
They reach the mill. He bids Guillot
I'll glance at house and garden plot.'
Tatyana wept and mourned her lot. . .
Of passions and escaped their lot;
A tale of lovers and their lot,
Some feeling for Tatyana's lot,
Shall instantly decide his lot.
For trumpeting its happy lot
'Where we are not.'
In something somehow, have we not?
In taking joy while loving not.
More happy he who knew them not,
Or check accounts. You'd rather not?
Or if, unconsciously or not,
And captures worldly fame to boot!
Or Eden's joys for us are moot.
And vibrant life in taking root
In swirls about the china pot.
Madame de Stal, Bichat, Tissot.
Asked Tanya .. . and the children leapt
The girl whose letter he still kept
And where my buried heart is kept.
The household keys she always kept.
And by the moonlit grave they kept
Where first I loved, where first I wept,
In which a maiden heart had wept;
Their vigil and, embracing, wept.
And enmity with harsh contempt;
Who yawned with wife and friends, exempt
Once more the love . . . once more the dart!
Sing God knows whom in splendid art
His look was still a tender dart:
That seared my Tanya's wounded heart!
The blood within this withered heart:
Can you, so strong of mind and heart,
This raving discourse of the heart
Their girlish secrets of the heart
For fun, for dreaming, for the heart. . .
Like Petrarch then, he calms the heart,
They've vacancies galore . . . take heart!'
A freedom-loving, noble heart,
The monde abhors a fickle heart.
Is it because her simple heart
No, nothing touched his sombre heart,
So pious and so chaste of heart,
At first their differences of heart
(Although he thought him lacking heart),
I tore away my grieving heart;
Has so designed the human heart.
He proudly sang with open heart
Forebodings filled and pressed her heart.
To calm the tremor in her heart
And all the while she guards her heart
With all the surgings of your heart,
It reawakened Tanya's heart.
To calm the tumult in one's heart;
Had crowded deep within his heart.
And grim repentance gnaws his heart.
Eugene, who loved the youth at heart,
But my poor Lensky, deep at heart,
you whose mind shall know by heart
Sweet idleness! You have my heart.
Her simple, open country heart
This touching whimsy free of art,
Had carried back the fruits of art:
The sacred ecstasy of art;
To Moscow and the marriage mart!
So dignified, so awfully smart,
Their natures distant and apart.
That set Eugene and me apart.
Now stoop to play so base a part?
Of how these two had grown apart,
His thoughts had wandered far apart;
The vibrant voices, sits apart,
And his sad fate drew us apart. ..
With secret meanings they'd impart;
All this, of course, can help impart
And in their singsong tones impart
And liked his common sense in part.
She found a secret charm in part:
And he recalled, at least in part,
And in deceit will take no part?
He noticed nothing, took no part.
Without response and takes no part;
Might well have played a better part
To sigh, deceive, and play his part
She's no coquette in any part
To thirst with love in every part,
Was born to play this very part.
The lofty Muses of his art;
A line or two of Virgil's art.
God grant that in my careless art,
And judge her harshly from the start:
(With which my novel took its start);
You'll never guess . . . it's water-short!
Or would my fall perhaps be sport,
To find the stuff is heavy sport.. .
A learned, if pedantic, sort.
Is held in high esteem at Court?
His simple, coloured shoes of bast;
and plaits his simple shoes of bast.
The foes stood by with eyes downcast.
Instead of bristling like a beast;
More tender to the wounded beast;
True lovers of a funeral feast.
As if it were some funeral feast;
To visit come the Christmas feast,
Disarmed youth's heart... or tried at least.
Or send a wish by mail at least;
The world with good, or earn at least
She's in a hall; no bear at least;
By seeming in their words at least
And jealous anguish pierced her breast
And all the yearnings in our breast,
The gaping wound beneath his breast.
A single feeling in his breast;
To swim upon the water's breast;
What languor fills her lovely breast!
Then stir my blood and fill my breast!
I've got no strength . . . this weary breast
Is checked, relined, and soon made fast.
The fizzing wine comes gushing fast;
Above his bed and holds him fast.
And held my flaming bosom fast!
Past seedbeds to the brookso fast
And sealed the solemn compact fast,
A moment's thought whose trace shall last
For placid comfortand to last;
And for which song he paid at last
To have his couplet heard at last,
Beyond this great divide at last,
Alive once more and free at last,
The final hours come at last.
But there, enough; have done at last:
That our young pilgrim leave at last.
And cleanse this Chapter Five at last
That, panting, on a bench at last
And now he's at the porch at last;
And when he tried to speak at last,
When Tanya's ring turned up at last,
But now he slowly wakes at last,
Have read her tortured heart at last!
Has withered, withered now at last?
rom Romulus to Tuesday last.
The loves and intrigues of the past,
No trace of Tanya from the past.
Have known poor Tanya from the past!
The song they sang was from the past:
Of all digressions from the past.
Beneath it sings as in the past
But now, #62038; Muse, forget the past!
And now it's time, indeed long past,
The sense and taste of ages past.
Of anecdotes of ages past:
Which Ovid sang in ages past,
You've paid your due to follies past.
Once more can't wait till day is past.
The mysteries of its ancient past;
Disjointed dreamsobscure and vast;
But her old wits were slow at best.
Like drunken Delvig* at a fest!
With nasty gossip or a jest. . . .
And may his dear old bones be blest
Would thank his stars to be so blest.
And in those days when I was blest,
Was quite a lovely country nest,
A dactyl from an anapest.
And flock to tranquil wisdom's crest;
Some pots and basins, and the rest
But journeys too, like all the rest,
These lines more quickly than the rest.
Let's all go have a nice long rest. .. .
O spring! ... #62038; time of love's unrest!
Betrayed, was always glad to rest.
His languid brow looked strange at rest.
In Mother Earth where he's at rest.'
While on the floor Triquet's at rest
He treads the ice with care to test. . .
So he might lunch with them as guest,
That sees in sounds life's highest quest,
In tattered nightcap and his vest.
Pursuing belles with little zest;
For rooting in the ancient dust
For all lies veiled in misty dust.
Before that soul so bright and just!
No matter; fate's decree is just;
Of history's annals full of must,
Before that soft and simple trust,
Here's Pradt* or, better, Walter Scott!
She brought her gifts . . . and danced about,
Onto the porch and fussed about
Who's cross with everything about:
And so Eugene learned all about
Soft snow, knee-deep, lies all about;
The night-time lanterns all about;
Still glitter grandly all about;
Within five hundred years about),
And while the lamps both in and out
Her stricken face. When all came out
At forty he'd have had the gout,
The comet wine* comes gushing out,
The band of goblins, putting out
All laugh and argue, squeal and shout.
With banal ladies, men who shout,
He enterscork and bottle spout!
And to each mad and fevered rout
Onegin lifts an arm to rout
But no one hears his neighbour out;
And Lensky too; a light shines out;
And tears her golden earrings out;
Naively poured his secrets out;
Have eaten, drunk, grown bored and stout,
Remote one moment, gay the next;
He read his Gibbon and Rousseau;
Of Richardson and of Rousseau.
Were quite forgot; she bid adieu
And so let's part; farewell. . . adieu!
Would like to bid his heir adieu.
'And since my gingerbread surprised you!'
So short a time since I baptized you!' '
Or else ... or else . . . may God defend you!
You too, you mamas, I commend you
'Bout evil ghosts and girls like you;
She may be dreaming not of you.
Is sure to fall. . . and so will you.
I liked it once no less than you,
But what did I then find in you?
That, finding my ideal in you,
I envision In opening my soul to you?
Where are you? Come! I bow to you
A lady's love, I say to you,
And I'm deprived of this; for you 
Am quite as glad to write as you,
You epicures and sages, you;
Where first, Onegin, I saw you;
Dmitriev
The portly Mr. Pustyakv
Gvozdin, Buynov, Petushkv
Griboedov
And former couns'lor, old man Flynov,
And my first cousin, good Buynov,*
w
He inwardly began to draw
Caricatures of those he saw.
The Corsair, or the Wandering Jew,
To whom will all our faults be few?
He did respect a noble few,
So harsh and negative a view?
Nor did he scorn the odd review
The pages of some dull review,
With negligent lorgnettes in view.
He's urged to seek his doctors' view,
As through the dust by post he flew,
And make them magic songs anew.
While nothing new was in the new;
And bid us thuswise to renew
The still transparent woods renew
To laugh a bit at something new;
For all those haunts that I once knew . . .
Sole heir to all the kin he knew.
The tale that my Onegin knew ....
Your Grandison?' 'I never knew . . .
Perhaps he also dimly knew
Although to us they're hardly new.
And time would pass, till Olga'd brew
I fear that lingonberry brew
You fledglings from our Lyvshin's crew,*
But all at once for good withdrew
Onegin, taking it, withdrew
Arose . . . and instantly withdrew.
Can one not love our native Moscow?
'Speak ill of Moscow!
Perceive you as a freak on show,
A fervent author used to show
My youth betrayed, it's time to show
She loved to greet Aurora's show,
Dispatching chaps just anyhow,
Until at last she whispered low: '
His stubborn, thrusting horns held low
A standing deer with horns held low,
The world all fresh and white below.
A manor house and grove below,
Beside the couple's coach below,
To spy on Tanya down below
To inundate the fields below.
'Vladimir Lensky lies below.
Outside its banks in wayward flow;
Let's trace a winding brooklet's flow
And novels set her heart aglow;
Against the heavens' pallid glow,
Her cheeks retain their blazing glow
A maiden somewhat ripe in glow,
And coachmen by the fire's glow
Endowed with bright perfection's glow.
She doesn't greet the winter's glow,
She spied a distant hamlet's glow,
But listen as our friends speak low:
In our backwoods, as you'll allow,
On proper form; he'd not allow
Perhaps you'd like, you gentle fellow,
Monsieur l'Abb, a needy fellow,
Her father was a kindly fellow
Late from Tambv, a witty fellow
Lost in a past he found more mellow;
The Harlikvs were feeling mellow
Hm, hm, dear reader, feeling mellow?
His views on morals ever mellow,
Asleep till morn beneath her pillow;
To Olga, he would whisper low:
Look Tanya over good and slow;
So why do you pursue me now?
You won't abandon me, I know. 
It speaks to me in words I know.
Will be quite pleased to greet, I know;
He's hardly worth contempt, I know,
That recluse from the world we know
For books had vanished, as we know,
It's hard to bear (as you well know)
Impossible for mind to know;
That stranger no one seems to know?
And if it is, who wants to know?)
Its legend lets the stranger know:
'But tell me, Prince, you wouldn't know
And in the morning he won't know
Our neighbour, nurse, the one. . . you know!
'I'm happy, love . . . it's true, you know.'
Forgive me, but it's true, you know,
About the olden days . . . you know,
All this I now can let you know,
Though why they do, I hardly know).
And haunt their dreams. They worship now
What wintry frost surrounds her now!
Must occupy my pen for now;
Is silver bright with frosted snow.
Fir, forest, hedgehog, night, and snow,
Still fidget, freezing, in the snow,
And chase from nearby hills the snow,
Romp away, sweet lassies, now, 
With winter's brilliant rug of snow
Crackling the freshly fallen snow;
Upon our mournful northern snow.
Inhale the frostdust, gather snow
As cold and chaste as winter snow;
All wet, comes off in crumbly snow;
I vow, Has ever had and hasn't now!
I'm not quite in the mood just now.
Let God's own lightning strike you now!
Were your good friend before you now,
But I've no wish to praise you now;
And quite forgot. Its pathway now
Where over my poor nanny now
Sing our secret ditty now, 
Across the misted panes a row
The Vampire with his pensive brow,
Stretched out with death upon his brow,
My god! How stern that haughty brow,
There's bear and blizzard, bridge, and crow,
But fools will whisper . . . grin . . . and crow! . . .'
More common sense if I'm to grow,
And ever brighter, brighter grow.
Beside a spot where lindens grow.
Ripe red currants let us throw!
From boxes rising row on row.
Immodestly I'd seek to borrow
But if indeed I overborrow,
'The other. . .. But we'll talk tomorrow;
Some fables he could sell tomorrow,
'The morning star will gleam tomorrow,
What a sorrow
And I confess (in public sorrow)
Bard of The Feasts* and languid sorrow,
Tatyana's favourite. Now when sorrow
While I, perhaps, descend in sorrow
The cabby plods to hackney row.
My Tambov poet takes in tow;
My hero and of course I vow
By Baratynsky's penI vow:
Let me repay you with a vow
Who in an aimless, idle fix
Had reached the age of twenty-six,
A butterfly in blooms of May;
Is that it, friend?'Far from it. Nay!
In silence at the window bay.
Amid our forbears' vaunted day;
To tend a sick man night and day,
Red wine, by tumbler, night and day!' '
And uncurbed passions ruled the day.
Young Olga's friends to spend the day,
And honest virtue won the day.
Tatyana thanks them for the day;
And blest with all its cares the day,
Some cards with me to pass the day.
'It's time, my sweet, to greet the day;
A tender dream that she someday
Or if amid the fields one day
Proclaim from ship the dawn of day
Have withered with each passing day
What occupied, the livelong day,
And show you how he spent each day.
And wanders through those woods all day.'
And oftentimes she'd sit all day
Then follows her about all day.
How right toward me that awful day:
The scarcely risen, newborn day.
Where I'm so much abused today,
'Oh God! I'll see her. . . and today!
Which seems a touch absurd today!
And whist, which reigns supreme today,
'He promised he would come today,'
Have gone in quarantine today?
Than our glum rhymesters of today?.. . .
And are your kinfolk well today?
I'll finish up another day.
To take my rest from yesterday.
The cunning captive any day
To join his forebears any day;
And be avenged that very day.
And several maidens, far from gay
'How oft within his arms I lay,
And on a rumpled sofa lay
And all the world in silence lay
Which wines have come without delay?
He'd better leave without delay.
Zaretsky, carefully, then lay
I'd play
His eyes toward the stage and play
A little walk, some rest and play;
And then upon the end of play,
His languid spirit's fretful play
Where you spent wintertime in play;
His glasses on, he'd deign to play
Upon the table after play,
Tatyana never joined their play
For Satan treats all love as play.
Her rustic charms on full display.
Unsmiling faces on display;
As Boston, ombre (old men's play),
Green meads and golden cornfields lay,
To where the prostrate princess lay;
On hacked-out bluish ice that lay
But simply tell as best I may
Looks outand sees with some dismay,
And left Eugene in mute dismay.
Came due in turn, the girl's dismay,
The greedy horde demanding pay.
Deceitful vice was made to pay
He swore that he'd make Lensky pay
Beneath the moon's seductive ray.
In your imported coach, I pray,
Tatyana and your Olga, pray? . . .
Do you find him more pleasing, pray,
But can't you, friends, forgive her, pray,
Have patience, friends, I beg you, pray;
Beside the Spanish envoy, pray .. .
Tsimlynsky wine ... a whole array
On reaching land at last. Hurray!
Her morning tea upon a tray.
Shall I in grim detail portray,
But never would he lead astray
I pray, May I not roam too far astray. 
That Freedom's Champion went astray.
When wayward fate has made me stray
Until his valet brings his tray.
Safe in her woods and never stray.
Write odes,* good sirs, write odes, I say . . .
And what of keen lorgnettes, I say ... ?
Can that be he? It is, I say.
The family's well, I think I'd say;
Or as, more tenderly I'd say,
The things a simple girl would say,
And long since time, I'm sure you'd say!
Some moralistic novel, say,
To hear what I'm prepared to say
In this case, though, one has to say
What more can I in candour say? 
Or borrow thenfrom me, let's say.'
Each to his own, or so they say.
'Must be a Mason;* drinks, they say . . .
And blest the dark that comes to stay!
O horrors! No, she'd better stay
'Sufficient for one winter's stay;
Then yawned and turned his head away:
Then called his men and walked away.
Who late at night are whisked away
he bowed her head and moved away. . . .
He took her arm. She moved away . . .
Then led the lady, safe, away.
Not daring once to steal away!
o scorn me and to turn away; 
Might break his chains and slip away.'
Stood by a river. Far away
I've dreamt of Moscow far away!
Just says: "I can't", then broods away,
Just takes his leave and drives away
Be kind and send my doubts away;
Like leaves dank autumn rots away.
Oh yes, I'll go!'and straightaway
May in a trice be swept away:
In quite a keen, old-fashioned way,
I start upon an untrod way
With sock in hand he led the way
But shambles somehow down the way.
Might walk with him life's humble way!
But look, Onegin's at the gateway;
Instructs us in a moral way
A fleeing hare would cross her way,
When suddenly from ballroom doorway
'But when did fate cast him our way?
With verse in hand, looks Tanya's way
But fit for apes, who once held sway
(Their sex, alas, is hard to sway).
The giddiness of passion's sway?
Possessed him for a moment's sway . . .
Through marble entry rushes straightway,
Said Lensky in his friendly way,
Towards the sea I'd make my way.
I'm grateful now in every way. . . .
Outside her glassed-in entryway,
As fencelike they go flashing by.
And asks the stranger passing by,
The Russian winter passing by:
To help the rural day go by?
To strut their stuff and thunder by,
A tombstone tells the passer-by:
Old women beamed as she went by;
Another fruitless day went by.
Or when a shooting star flew by
And country dress would find no mercy;
Mot, that wine most blest and heady,
Is brought in bottle chilled and ready
Another memory finds me ready:
Why, pretty one, you're up already!
There gleam the city gates already!
Onegin kept his stallion ready
But he refused to go. He's ready
And almost fall; the poor thing's ready
To join the crowd, where each is ready
And when we wish it, always ready
Tatyana, though, stayed calm and steady
At first the neighbours' calls were steady;
But thank the Lord, you seem more steady;
And they prevailed. Her lips more steady,
Farewell now, scene of fame unsteady,
To hiss at Phdreso unsteady,
And hold the lucky stirrup steady,
You're like a comrade, ever steady,
A simple but a nice old lady;
Sealed off at last from everybody,
Set to a children's melody:
And once inside that silent study,
They made the barking hounds obey,
Fair crystal of my soul and key
Where hills half circle round a valley,
Meand'ring from the nearby valley.
Thus stormy shadows cloak with grey
Make Chateaubriand's works seem grey;
In early youth he'd been the prey
Come on, Andryushka, faster, matey!
That held her heart, she knew not why)
An idle stillness rules the sky,
But there beneath the Finnish sky,
A is like a mistressfrisky,
Ai* I find is much too risky,
To live he hurries and to feel makes haste. Prince Vjazemsky
Beneath my Africa's warm sky,*
Baratynsky
And there the caustic Shakhovsky
Zhukovsky
They take her to the Grand Assembly:*
She knew the Russian language badly,
Is lacking yet one feature badly:
And Flynov, who'd been reeling badly-
On dining chairs have bedded gladly;
For its sake once, I squandered gladly
Ignored our journals all too gladly,
With loving eyes that seek you gladly;
Of acting foolish, raving madly,
To see you and pursue you madly!
But moist Odessa, all too sadly,
Not aiming yet, the foes took boldly
She yields without conditions, boldly
'Approach at will!' Advancing coldly,
The flirt will always reason coldly;
In time he might have changed profoundly,
Have quit the Muses, married soundly;
Italian voices ringing loudly;
A sudden clink of spurs rings loudly,
The stout Moldavian prancing proudly;
As Tanya's husband enters proudly
In days when I still bloomed serenely
To fall asleep at home serenely;
Drops in for whist and joins routinely;
An honest man who'd served sincerely,
He trusted all she did sincerely
The guests all treated so sincerely;
Has been decreed. I may have merely
Well, thus am I. And was it merely
To Lovelace Grandison, but merely
I've looked it over most severely;
I need, And I submit to it securely.
How quick she's mastered, how securely,
He wrote thuslimply and obscurely.
Though he's unknown and lives obscurely,
But tea is brought: the girls demurely
That's not romanticism, surely;
He's still an honest chap, most surely.
The haughty world would watch her closely
And whisper to each other closely:
The neighbours shake their heads morosely
And pass him medicines morosely
Tatyana heard the news morosely
Though here and there much labour lately
For fooling clever men completely,
She turns all offers down completely,
He craves her pardon so completely,
He looked the poet so completely
'Come warm yourself,' he adds politely,
In French he could and did acutely
And bows he'd mastered absolutely.
The time to quit the feast and fly,
'Good gracious, how the years do fly!'
To dazzle, conquer . . . and to fly.
But quickly summer seems to fly,
Unseen by bee or butterfly.
As down the shortest road they fly;
And now they trundle Tanya daily
The faces one encounters daily,
The social cream had gathered gaily:
With grandams and granduncles gaily
Of one consumptivewan and sickly.
Her soul, unmoved, grows wan and sickly;
Alas, Tatyana's fading quickly;
Onegin, though, is fading quickly;
And Tanya's youth now glimmers darkly:
The glow of life has vanished starkly;
Their pitchers in the stream and dally;
Through greening fields, and watch it dally
'Why all these yawns, Onegin? Really!'
It wasn't that she'd read him, really,
One swats at flies in mindless folly;
And read my Apuleius keenly,
One likes to bask in melancholy;
Yet still Onegin slumbers deeply.
But now the sun climbs heaven steeply,
Tatyana waits: will he reply?
Too deaf and still to make reply
And I can hear your stern reply.
And cutting off Eugene's reply,
Vladimir gave a curt reply
And yet her husband loved her dearly;
'Mere habit, Lensky.''But you're clearly
I've got the scene in mind so clearly:
Unsealed your heart to me so clearly?
It has its contradictions, clearly,
On stormy Zeus's orders clearly:
'And happiness was ours ... so nearly!
'Why did you leave last night so early?'
He gave a ball some three times yearly,
For six whole weeks it happens yearly,
For all to see, or on the sly;
And, oh, how base to pamper grossly
'Her younger sister married neatly;
He used to banter rather neatly,
He praised Odessa's gardens greatly.
To take his grieving bride directly
'My second?' said Eugene directly.
The clever husband chose correctly
A friend of mine, whom you. . . correctly! 
With misty eyes he looks on sweetly
Or sometimes Idol mio* sweetly
And drowsy nature, smiling lightly,
The plain inscription, skimming lightly;
It fizzes, foams, and bubbles lightly
Pronounced a Russian n as slightly
Now greets the dawning season brightly.
Those joyous hopes that bloomed so brightly
Like Hippocrene* it sparkles brightly,
A tiny window glitters brightly,
You mourn the poet, friends . . . and rightly:
Will draw her leather reins up tightly
She laced her corset very tightly,
He steers her, gliding nonchalantly,
And bending, whispers her gallantly
'The mail has kept him evidently.'
Tatyana blushed and trembled gently.
And play but chords; or turning gently
Then draws her to a corner gently
He'd sit at clavichord intently
Onegin stares at her intently,
Eugene would hear his views intently
He was no fool; and consequently
And Olga too; Eugene alertly
She sinks in snow; the bear alertly
She lies within his arms inertly;
My bold Buynov guides expertly
And so decayed, until he duly
You poets who have sinned unduly:
Her worth (yet cursing fate unduly)
And happy, he'd have learned life truly;
I ask you now to tell me truly,
Or where the husband, knowing truly
And here's an envoy speaking slyly
They all began to gossip slyly,
Who joked both cleverly and wryly
To joke and comment (rather wryly);
'The will of God, I guess .... My Danny
But nowadays I'm not so canny,
I get confused . . .' 'But tell me, nanny,
'Then how'd you come to marry, nanny?'
In love with Tanya like a boy;
'Who is she, though?' 'My wife, old boy.'
Refreshed the stage with comic joy,
By thoughts of love, by dreams of joy.
But I'll present you now with joy.'
Or if upon her left she'd spy
And use a furtive ear to spy.
Your solemn gaze may only spy
Who doesn't find dissembling dreary;
And even in their slander dreary.
But now the monument stands dreary
Or sometimes after dinners dreary,
Alone the shepherd, grey and weary,
(Recasting platitudes till weary)
When some good neighbour drops in weary
They seem so pallid and so weary,
Our Russian troikas never weary;
And here's Petrvsky Castle,* hoary
What household goods are necessary:
And when he found it necessary
For winter. Then, in January,
For fashions change, and views will vary,
Of course it's so. And yet be wary,
The London social sets decry
To your repeated, desperate cry?
And with one voice the grannies cry:
But Tanya found she couldn't cry;
Who never drained life's chalice dry,
Our bold Autmedons* stay cheery,
He draws sweet views of rustic scenery,
A Venus temple, graves and greenery;
And lures us to the tree of mystery:
The grave's eternal, fateful mystery,
Five versts or so from Krasnogory,
No secret crimes or passions gory
I wanted with Albani's glory*
It wears with pride its recent glory:
A Russian family's age-old story,
The prejudice that haunts all history,
Our Mother Eve's disastrous history:
But forward, forward, #62038; my story!
At the beginning of my story
The usual three-cart train will carry
'Well, I won't keep you, have no worry,
How early he could stir or worry
'You mustn't think . . . and please don't worry . . .
'Ah me, these poets . . . such a hurry!'
'Oh, nurse, a favour, please . . , and hurry!'
The fall that year was in no hurry,
Instructs his man as well to hurry:
You too, indulgent reader, hurry
Onegin, dressing in a flurry,
To leave the city with its flurry,
As vulgar. (I won't even try
Malvina* for three roubles fifty
(A broken set, but he was thrifty);
Where will he dash to, my good hearty?
There'll be a ball, a children's party;
One couldn't label her a beauty;
Profoundly loved, in its cold beauty,
Soon Olga's happy voice and beauty
But spiteful people saw no beauty
To share with all the world her beauty,
A captive of his lot and duty,
And I, who saw my single duty
Of what, with fashion's sense of duty,
Again he'd done his moral duty,
Tatyana (with a Russian duty
In russet wig and fine pince-nez.
